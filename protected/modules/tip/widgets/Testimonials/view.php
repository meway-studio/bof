				<span class="t-comment">«Basing on the understanding that gaming events have always been accompanying human existence and will continue to in future, one can state with confidence that the desire to bet on the outcome of a certain sports contest, bet on the result, win and, unfortunately, lose will always exist. That’s why it’s important to minimize negative consequences of your bets.»</span>

				<span class="t-comment">«Any player is inherently a hot-tempered person, that’s why it’s important to keep your head. You should never bet your last money as you run the risk of losing everything on the first of the gaming days and skip a bet which can bring profit to you on the second gaming day.»</span>

				<span class="t-comment">«Bet on a sports event but by no means on the odds which can be both too low if an event’s result is evident or too high in case of a bookmaker’s mistake or bias in the informational realm. Be ready to lose because it’s impossible both to win and lose constantly. Despondency and disappointment can’t be your friends in the betting issue.»</span>
