The team was reigforced, with players and manager Marinos Ouzounidis. Platanias had a very good preseason and even though offensively they still need some work, they seem fully prepared for kick off.

On the other hand, Veroia was saved in the last day in the latter campaign and avoid relegation was a great achievment! This season it will be a miracle as long as the team lost many players and those who came didn't shown anything until now. The preparation left mixed feelings with the good defensive functionality as the most positive outcome.

Last year Veroia saved their asses by winning Platanias in the last day of the season. The game was rather 'fixed' but the final score 5-0 was too harsh for Platanias who are now searching for revence. Platanias is the better team here, they have 'high official friends' in the association and asuming that the last season game was a fixed up, this may be pay back time.

Ernesto Valverde can not count ok striker Aduriz and defender San Jose. Kike Sola will replace Aduriz up frond and this looks pretty nice for Athletic as long as Aduriz had lost his form in the last quarter of the last season. Sola is faster too, so the tough pucela defense will be tested.

Possible XI: Iago Herrerín - Iraola, Laporte, Gurpegui, Saborit - Iturraspe, Beñat, Herrera – Susaeta, Muniain, Kike Sola

Squad: Iraizoz y Herrerín y los jugadores de campo Toquero, Laporte, Morán, Beñat, Iturraspe, Kike Sola, De Marcos, Ibai, Susaeta, Iraola, Gurpegui, Muniain, Herrera, Saborit, Ekiza y Balenziaga.";;0;0;2,01;6;6,06;2;

The truth is the both teams will play their best in the field in the opening day today. Real made an impressive preparation and their squad is even better than last season. Ancelotti is picking Casillas in the goal, Carvahal in the right back, Isco in the left wing, Modric-Khedira in the middle, CR7-Benzema upfrond.

Betis on the other hand have a completely new team this season. This has to do with some missings as long and with several departures of key players. Of course there are new players in, but they need to adopt the new system. Questions about key striker Ruben Castro FW*** who remains out.

The new signing forwards, Nunez and Riera may be better in skills but they are definitely lacking experience. Riera coming from segunda and Nunez of unknown quality.

On the other hand Granada have some great guys to showoffensively. The 4 guys, El Arabi, Piti, Benitez and Brahimi  up front are of great pace and skills, they can destroy Osasuna's defense! Iturra and Yebda secure a solid middle line.";;0;0,5;1,93;7;6,51;2;

Villarreal was ok with a draw, Almeria was asking only for the win. Villarreal won the game and sent Almeria in playoffs where the Andalusians won the promotion. Just like they finished the last season, they start the new one. In a friendly game they played in neutral ground, Almeria won by 1-0 but Marcelino fielded Villarreal with many subtitutes.

Villarreal is a team with a much better squad and as I wrote in the season preview they are here to stay and most probably fight for a EL ticket. On the other hand Almeria will struggle and will play it to individual tough fights in order to win points. Of course they will be based in their ground. Both with a few missings, kind of notable but not important. Both possible Xis looks promising to offer offensive soccer but as long as it is an opening game the two rivals will be careful today avoiding to play open and risk anything.

Prieto was they only one Txuri urdin player who was part of that team as a priomising youngster and now is the star of the team! Socieada won comfortably against Getafe on Saturday without even accelerating and they are fully ready for this game. Montanier who is now in France will definitely said a couple of hints and tips for his former assistant Arrasate who is now in charge. Key winger Griezmann who were rested against Getafe is the nod today. Berkara is also back to reigforce the middle line. Agirretxe FW**, Irfan FW and Mikel Gonzales DF** are out.

Lyon is doing a remarkable start in the new season! They won two ligue 1 games and two CL games against Grasshopers. Lyon have yound primising players and their only missings regarding the latter campaign are Lissadro (left), Gomis and Brain. First choice keeper Vercoutre is injured.

Lyon are too strong at home but Sociedad are experts in counter attacking. Goals should be scored from both. The Basques will search for at least one and odds on both to score are unexpectedly high.";;0;;2;6;-6,00;3;

The return leg is following next week at the Camp Nou. Atletico and Barcelona opened the new La Liga season with victories, Barcelona humiliated Levante by 7-0 and Atletico slaped Sevilla away by 1-3. Diego Costa and Messi were the MVPs.

In Atletico there is David Villa who is searching to prove to his former club his worth. The game will be really important for him, but individual victories are risky for any team. Simeone will give him a starting up role today just like in Sevilla but Leo Baptistao will be waiting to grab the opportunity from the bench. No important missings for Atletico neither for Barcelona who's starting XI is a bit more complicated. Martino may field Neymar from the start and leave Xavi out, but it is quite possible to repeat the team that started against Levante with Neymar on the bench.

Who ever plays makes no big difference though. The changes Martino is trying to make in Barcelona's style are more important and at last, we can see the team playing in full power and not torturing the ball with eyes suffering tiki-taka small passes. Barcelona is playing more rapid offensively and with more players in the oppsite area, the side backs are getting straight in next to Messi.

Anyway, there is a second leg to be played next week, but odds on Barcelona are really nice today.";;0;-0,75;2;7;-7,00;3;

Athletic won in Valladolid in the opening day while Osasuna suffered a well deserved home defeat against Granada.

Athletic has striker Aduriz back in the team after the last one served his ban while keeper Iraizoz got injured so Herenin is steping in. This change was set to happen in the opening day because Iraizoz spend many days in the preseason injured and it is no secret that he is not the 'keeper' he were in the past years. So Athletic is in full power. Striker Kike Sola who came from Osasuna said that he will not celebrate a possible goal, but he will definitely have his chances tomorrow.

Osasuna will have a hard task this season in La Liga. They lost some players in the summer and the new signings are not at the same level. The first test wasn't positive against Granada and today Mendilibar is obligated to field a team without key attacking midfielder Miguel De las Cuevas  MD*** and winger Cejudo WG*. The good news is that Gato Silva MD** is available to organise the middle line. Miguel Flaño CB, Eneko Satrústegui DF, Lolo MD* and  Nino FW*, remain out.

Athletic is the favorite here and they should built on the away win in Valladolid.  Osasuna will try to win back the lost home points but there is a quality gap here in Athletic favor and it is up to them to decide the game. The ground is neutral but 20.000 of the fans will be their supporters and bearing in mind last leason's performances in San Mames, it sounds better for Athletic not to play there! Of course this had everything to do with Llorente. Now that he left, things will definitely get better in the home ground of Athletic.";;0;-0,75;2,01;7;7,07;2;

Moreover, Agirretxe FW**, Irfan FW and Mikel Gonzales DF** remain out with Enrique Royo GLK, Dani Estrada DF, Sangalli (?) and Markel Bergara MD* coming back in the squad.
Arrasate will mix his team again as he did against Getafe before the trip to Lyon. Ansotegi DF, Elustondo MD, Pardo MD* and Chory Castro  FW* are taking the nod today while new signing Granero MD** is also set to feature. So, despite the noumerous missings, Sociedad is about to be fielded with a quite competitive team today.

Bravo - Estrada, Iñigo Martínez, Ansotegi, De la Bella - Bergara, Elustondo, Xabi Prieto - Castro, Vela, Seferovic.

Elche on the other hand are newcomers, they are enthousiastic playing in front of their supporters in La Liga for the first time in the last 25 years, but the feelings in the opening day were not positive. They lost easy in Vallecas by 3-0. Today another experienced La Liga player is set to debutize in the starting XI, Javi Márquez MD** former Espanyol and Mallorca player. There are some missings and a player back but nothing important.

Elche are full of enthousiasm today but Real Sociedad is clearly the better team. Lyon's visit in Anoeta in four days obligates Arrasate to rotate but Real will field a quite competitive team.

Today key striker Ruben Castro returns while Nosa and Jorge Molina got the call in the squad after suffering minor knocks recently.

Celta on the other hand succumped in a home draw to Espanyol. They got the lead by 2-0 but received twice in the second part and could have got another one in injury time. Most worrying is that Espanyol played really bad but instead of that they scored twice against Celta.

He played 99 games in Levante, key player in the middle line in recent years, and just a week ago he was transferred to Sevilla! He is playing his No100 game in La Liga today and it is against his ex team! Another interesting fact is that Levante's manager Joaquin Caparros he has only won 3 times in 15 games playing against his former team.

He is set to field Levante with three midfielders in order to destroy Sevilla's creativity. Last minute missing of Diop is making his work more difficult. Looking at Levante's squad though you can find great offensive minded players such as  Rubén García, Xumetra, Pedro Ríos and Ivanschitz and the key today for Levante will be to play offensively. Anyway, Caparros is set to field three midfielders and the two will be Sergio Pinto and El Adoua and he is searching for the third.

Sevilla had an impressive preseason and three great EL games but when they had to play a strong team they suffered a home defeat to Atletico. This is another hard test and the greatest handicap for Sevilla is their poooooor on the road record. They didn't win a single away game the last season in La Liga! Cristoforo is a new addition, Iborra as well. Trochowski, Reyes and Pareja remain out.

When was the last time we bet on Sevilla away from their home? We regret it, I think it was in Getafe who were playing depleted through missings. Sevilla under Emery cannot win on the road, Levante despite the opening day desaster in Barcelona they were prepared very well and will make a hard rival today.";;0;0,25;2,01;7;3,54;2;

Granada started with an away win in Osasuna confirming their quality and good state of form. Alcaraz have Riki FW** available while Siquera, who is already on his way out and didn't even take part in the preseason, makes no important missing.

On the other hand, Ancelotti can not count on Xabi Alonso MD***, Asier Illarramendi MD** and Sami Khedira MD* and as you can see there will be a few problems in controling the game in the middle and producing creative football.  Brazilean Casemiro MD from RM Castilla will start and most probably Isco will play behind his natural position.

Ladbrokes still offers +1,5 at 1,9 and I will take that bet. Granada is fielding an increadible offensive line composed by Brahimi, Benitez, Piti and El Arabi (or Riki) and have great alternatives coming from the bench, Riki (or El Arabi), Yegda, Buonannote. Real faced many problems in the opening day against Betis and they don't seem 100% ready for official start.

Levante was demolished in Barcelona in the opening day but didn't try enough hosting Sevilla last week. They got the goal-less draw in a game where Sevilla was also seemed ok with that.

It is not a secret that Joaquin Caparros, Levante's new manager, is keen on defensive tactics. Levante was already a tema hard to score against, they will become a tougher rival as time goes by. Of course in Barcelona they just... disappeared. Pape Diop MD** and Baba Diawara FW* debutize in the squad. The first was injured in the last games while Baba is a new signing from Sevilla. The other new signing Rémi Gomis MD remains unavailable.

Rayo lost key players in the summer but some new guys look quite promising to cover. They had a great opening game against Elche but Atletico was all over them last week to beat them by 5-0. Seba FW* from Sevilla and Ze Castro CB* from Deportivo are the new signings. Seba will help a lot offensively and he is set to feature today in the list (not announced yet).

Celta drew at home to Espanyol and won in Betis, while Granada won in Pamplona and lost at home to Real Madrid. So according to the stats Celta is the better team here and deserves the favoritism.

I only want to remind you that Celta almost lost the game to Espanyol at home against a team that didn't even reach their 30% and they miraculous won in Sevilla against a much better Betis side. In these two games they only created 15 scoring opportunities. On the other hand Granada created 21 scoring opportunities so far and they played against defensive minded Osasuna away and against Real Madrid at home. This is a much better achievement comparing the two rivals and I also want to remind you that Real Madrid won really hard by 0-1, with the players wasting time in the last minutes and Ancelotti going into defensive-minded changes ! More over Granada was denied two possible penalties...

Anyway, Lucas Alcaraz took the same squad as in the opening two games, leaving the new signings out. Recio MD*, Ighalo FW** and Foulquier joined Granada and there is no doubt they will help a lot but at the moment the team enjoys an excellent state of form and mister don't want to ruin anything.

Celta have to play without key holding midfielder Borja Oubiña through suspension. The team appealed against his sanction but it was rejected on Friday afternoon (a few minutes ago). Possible substitutes of Oubina are Fontás, Álex López, Levy Madinda and Javi Rey. Well, Fontas is a center back, Javi Rey is too young Alex Lopez is a winger and Madinda played in this position in the b' team and suffered to play his role. Oubina's missing will not be covered in my opinion.";;0;0,25;2;8;4,00;2;

Betis on the other hand have lost both their opening games to Madrid against Real and at home to Celta.

I was set to take Betis here but after watching Espanyol performance against Valencia – amazing offensive game with many scoring opportunities mainly through crosses – and reading the news that Beti's key striker Ruben Castro FW*** and center back Paulau DF* are out, I am going to the over2.5.

Espanyol have great guys upfront, Pizzi, Sergio Garcia, Stuani and even Simao seems reborn this season, while Betis have also great offensive power – even without Castro – and the most important is that they can not defend properly.

Atletico made a fine start to the season with two wins over Sevilla and Rayo while Sosiedad won Getafe but with an eye on Lyon they succumbed in a away draw against Elche. History stats are on Atletico side who have three wins in a row in San Sebastian. Still, Real isn't any pushovers, they are in the CL group stages and the game is 50%-50%.

On the other hand, Osasuna lost important players in the summer and are suffering some important missings through injuries. They are not better than Getafe in quality but unlike Getafe, they are playing better in these opening games. They have lost them all, but at least against Villarreal they performed some attractive football, passes and nice movements in the pitch.

In a few words, Valencia is the favorite here. Betis will strangle with all these key missings. Jorge Molina is a good striker, but he is not Ruben Garcia.

Despite their bad form in the Ukranian league, this is the first CL game for  Shakhtar who still can afford a great squad with 8-9 international Ukrainians and foreign players.

The point is that  Shakhtar is able to score at the San Sebastian and of course Real Sociedad will follow or the other way around.

Two other bets on them went luckily VOID, in Elche they could have received 2 or 3 in the 1st part (1-0 and 1-1FT) while in Levante the hosts deserved much better than the goal-less draw. Sociedad hosts Malaga and in a few days on Wednesday they travel in Barcelona! There is La Liga action in the midweek.

Granada got injured. I saw him making the play in Levante, at least trying, but his loss is important as long as Sociedad went in the hunt for a new center midfielder. Granero will stay 5 months out.

In fact, most of the times Almeria pays the price of their enthousiasm, just like the shocking home equalizer they received from Elche in 94' from offside position, the late penalty succumbed against Getafe on the road (2-2) and the dying minutes collapse in the opening game against Villarreal 2-1 until 83', 2-3 FT. Left full back Dubarbier served his one day ban but he was left out most probably because of the silly hand ball that led to Elche's equalasing 1-1 two weeks ago and the own goal he 'scored' against Villarreal...

Levante have started playing better and especially defensively they received only one in the last three games leaving the Barcelona opening day demolishion far behind them.

What is for granted here is that Valencia had no good signs before the season start and didn't get any better while Sevilla, who lays rock bottom since Osasuna won last Friday, started with upside-downs but becoming more solid game by game with the new guys adopting the style of the team.

Sevilla had two nice games recently, in Barcelona and Estoril where they played with reserves but were clearly the better side. Now Emery wants revence! He returns in Valencia from where he was sucked 2-3 years ago. Rightly he was sacked, maybe they parted companies, but Emery was not the manager for Valencia – as it seems Djukic isn't either. Anyway, Emery is in Sevilla now and is facing his former players.

Rami CB** is out for Valencia, Pereira RB* returns, no important missings for Sevilla, Perotti LW, Reyes RW, remain out.

I don't know what the Valencia players will do in the Djukic matter but I doubt that a pro players who plays in Valencia will step seeking for his manager's sacking... Not even that increadible Dutch Kooman had that fate a few years ago... I won't go for Sevilla though, but I will take the over2,75 as long as goals are expecting here. It is a game with great expectations and motivation for both, they just can't sit back and defend their lines.";;0;2,75;2,06;7;7,42;2;

His Bilbao outfit has a hard task tonigh in Barcelona. Athletic haven't won a single game there since 1998 losing 10 games and drawing 5... During the latter campaign Athletic snitched a point and this is the least they are set to get today as long as just like Espanyol - who visiting Vila-Real - Athletic are hosting Betis on Thursday and need to keep their squad fresh and at the weekend they play Betis and Granada respectively. Hard schedule for these two and the rest teams in primera of course.

Two defenders are back for Espanyol, Moreno who was rested last week and Capdevilla debutizing after a long term injury. No important missings for Espanyol while Athletic will have to do again without their left side backs as long as Balenziaga and Saborit remain out. Kike Sola FW* is also out, Ekiza CB too.

The numbers and the players' quality are pointing in a bet on Athletic +0,25 but as long as the tradition and the defensive functionality of the Basques are important factors against this bet, I will take the over2.5 which, actually, is being offered in great prices.

In the opening day against Villarreal they went up by 2-1 and lost in the dying minutes by 3-2, in Getafe they went by twice before succumping in a late draw, the same fate they suffered hosting Elche and getting the equalizer in the 94 minutes from offside position of Elche's scorer Boakye and last weekend they got a 2-0 lead and right after their 2nd goal their left back Cristian received two yellows in the same dead ball situation, a corner from the right for Levante, and was sent off with Levante shorteting distance with the penalty won...! Levante had another goal scored a few minutes later, but Almeria was the one who deserved much more in the game despite playing for many more than half hour with 10 players...

Malaga impressed in Sevilla and at home to Rayo and they got a deserved point in San Sebastian with Sociedad resting three regulars.

Malaga showed good signs and this is obvious telling by their recent results and performances. Almeria played some great games, wingers Suso and Vidal are amazing players the first joined from Liverpool and the 2nd is a Spanish sub20 international, and the fact that Almeria doesn't have the respect they deserve in offered odds makes their +0,75 today a decent option.

Even Manquillo was awesome debutizing in the right back position in Vallecas and now Juanfran and Arda who were rested against Valladolid are stepping in. The only minus in taking Atletico here is the upcoming city derby against Real Madrid but then again this derby makes a reason for an emphatic win and a morale boost today. Osasuna won against Elche their first game in the season, but, this doesn't make them a team able to stand in the Vicente Calderon. Moreover, besides the noumerous and known misings of Echaide DF, Miguel Flaño CB, De las Cuevas MD**, Cejudo MD, Nino FW* another blow was added to the list, Roberto Torres who have been their MVP twice recently.;;0;-1,75;2;7;-7,00;3;

Maybe his time was fullfiled in Levante anyway... I was so rergetful for backing Levante in Almeria last weekend. But luckily, I was lucky, as long as old fox Juanfran 'won' a penalty from Almeria's Cristian taking him in two booking in the same dead ball situation after theatrically (mostly) diving to the ground... Levante deserved to lose in Almeria and deserved to lose big.

Their two strikers Baba and Nong are what I was afraid of. Too soft for Levante who traditionally had great strikers in the likes of Martins, Kone and Caicedo...  El Zhar who had a nice game in Almeria is out, some others remain.

Valladolid was of course too weak for Atletico Madrid, but they have shown that against equal teams especial on the roda they can be really tough and hard to beat. In Villarreal they were impressive from times to times and in Elche they got an easy draw  after balancing the game 20 minutes to it.

No new problems for Emery. Rayo is the first team that had more ball posseision than Barcelona since 2008! The 0-4 was a hard result for Rayo who are going into their worst season start ever especially defensively, 5-0 to Atletico, 5-0 in Malaga, 0-4 hosting Barcelona. Lass in back but Tito who is covering all the right side from defence to the attack is out and he will be missed.

He was called back to apologize from Granada so he is missing, Ricardo Costa is missing too so ...problems in defense which is already vulnerable. Winning against Sevilla doesn't makes Valencia any giants. Granada got a 0-0 draw in the region derby against Betis with Lucas Alcaraz rotating his squad big enough! Riki FW** didn't playu a minute while Dani Benitezlw***, Brahimi RW*** and Yebda CDM came as substitutes. Now Dani Benitez has been surprisingly dropped as well, but the others are set for a starting up role. Ighalo FW is available as well, defender Foulquier will debutize. Diego Mainz DF*, Piti FW** remain injured. Buonanote and newcomer excellent wingers from Mallorca Pereira, will cover for Piti (already missed 3 games) and Benitez, wile Murillo has taken the nod in defence more than once this season.

In the attack, Stuani FW*, Pizzi FW* and Simao WG are also set to start to the bench with Lanzattore, Thievy and Fernandez stepping in.

Michel will also be missed in the center and the worst is that Lacen returns from injury... Varela is also important for Getafe covering all the right side of the team. August is a missing for Celta, Nolito as well but Nolito was already been benched ion the last game with Rafinha and Krohn-Dehli coming to cover.

Today Pepe Mel keeps on with his rotation tactics leaving Perquis DF* and Vadillo MD* out while Juan Carlos MD**, Rubén CastroFW*** remain out. Castro is an excellent striker BUT hasn't constributed at all in the nes season due to his injury. Moreover Betis has shown that they have great alternatives.

Valverde is also set to introduce some changes. Iraizoz retains position in the goal, while Susaeta and Herrera returns after being rested in Espanyol. The problem in the left side in defence remain as long as Saborit and Balenziaga are still injured. Betis have great history stas in Bilbao, 2 wins in the last 2 years and 4-7-4 overall, while Pepe Mel has never lost there winning 3 and drawing 1.

One of the relevations of the season, left back half Bergdich was sent off but he is now available to play as long as the appeal committee must have edited his sanction. Key forward Ebert, who have yet to find his good form struggling from injuries, is fit to feature. He was a doubt in last days.

Malaga got a deservedly home win against Almeria who were proved too 'innocent' to beat a team like Malaga away from home. It was a nice game from Malaga who had mid Portillo their MVP for second game in a row. Schuster has the same squad for 3rd game. Valladolid is strugling to creat danger against well organized defensively sides. On the road, this is their only weapon, to play full defense, but at home they  were competitive only against Getafe and struggled big time against Athletic de Bilbao and of course Atletico last weekend losing easily. Malaga is a tough team, solid in defense no doubt and with great guys up front.

Elche comes from Wednesday's 'Real Madrid massacre' a result that raised their morale but left them with their manager Fran Escriba and defensive half Carlos Sánchez. Moreover Sapunaru RB* remains out for 3rd game. Elche have yet to win a game in La Liga while Celta have only one win away in Betis in 6 games.

Both will be motivated here but I am going with the hosts who have made some excellent home performances against Sociedad 1-1,  Valladolid 1-1 and Real 1-2, while Elche struggled away in Rayo lost 3-0, Almeria 2-2 and Osasuna lost by 2-1.

They lost 2-1 and today Aguirre is fielding his best XI minus Fuentes who is injured. Getafe on the other hand, faced Celta reserves and won by 2-0 without impressing. It worth to mention that against Celta their MVP was a central defender, Lisandro who is missing today through injury and this makes another missing in defense.

Mel had important missings, fielded his team with subs and still his first changing was a sub replace a so called regular... Today the missings of Ruben Castro FW*** and Jose Carlos WG** remains still, with Mel surprisngly dropping Cedrick WG** out of the call! Villarreal is a solid team and have an almost full squad with the exception of left back Costa.

Against Real, Espanyol and most recently Valencia, they performed in a decent level and especially the midweek defeat to Valencia was too hursh for them. Lucas Alcaraz have only one missing to cope with as long as Piti remains sidelined. Center back Diego Mainz returns. Some changes were announced but these lead to Granada's stronger version. Riki in attack instead of out of form El Arabi, Mainz in defence replacing Diakathe, Yedba and Fran Rico in the center of the field instead of Recio and Ittura. Dani Benitez who was dropped against Valencia may takes a starting up role while Alcaraz didn't deny that he may use a formation with two strikers.

Athletic on the other hand are known for their quality and vertical football but they are known for their 'on the road' instability as well. They won in the opening day in Valladolid against a much weaker rival, they lost without fighting in the Bernabeu and were succumbed in Espanyol by 3-2. No important missings than the known ones in the left back position with Valverde dropping Itturaspe to call another defender in the list (Etxeita). The starting lineup today is a mistery, but the not more than 2 changes regarding the last game are expected.

Granada at home makes a tough rival even against high flying teams. Athletic isn't such a team away from home. What have been missing to Granada is the ball going to the opposite nets. If they play at the same level as against Valencia they won't lose today. Odds are too generous for Athletic and they keep diving. Yesterday the 0,25 ball on Granada was around 1,75 and the DNB at 2,08. Now odds went up to 1,81 and 2,20 respectively!

As a matter of fact, Betis managed to win only this weird Valencia team recently at home with los Valencianos making their rival look like Barcelona in their glorious days! Pepe Mel will introduce changes once again today. Rubιn Castro FW***, Juan Carlos MD**, Paulao CB* are injured, Chica LB, Matilla MD are not registered in EL, while Chuli FW and Vadillo MD** stayed in Sevilla to take a rest.

Rijeka on the other hand are not pushovers, despite losing heavily in the opening day of the group stage in Guimaraes. The Croacians were advanced in the group stages by eliminating Stuttard with a 2-1 home win and a 2-2 away draw! They are unbeaten in Croatia with 6 wins and 5 draws. This game is important for another one reason for Rijeka. Just like today 29 years ago they beat Valladolid by 4-1 to get to the UEFA Cup next round and being eliminated by Real after a thrilling 2 games draw, winning in Croacia by 3-1 and losing in Bernabeu by 3-0!

Osasuna confirms the preseason bleak predictions as long as the summer departures and missing in attack are the reasons for their huge scoring problems. The new arrivals are not high class players and next to the numerous missings the team has been facing it is nothing strange to have such a terrible record to show. Last week they deserved more in the 1st part hosting Levante, but as long as their forwards failed in clear cuts opportunities, Osasuna could not ask for a better fate even though Levante's dying minutes winner-penatly was fake. Levante was better in the 2nd part. Today senor Gracia has to cope with the known missings of  Echaide DF, Miguel Flaño CB, Roberto Torres MD*, Nino FW*, Raoul Loe DH*, plus Cejudo's MD due to sanction. Oriol LB is back though with Gracia thinking about fielding three defensive halves just like he did in Atletico.

Malaga on the other hand lost key players in the summer but covered the missings with new guys and manager's Schuster philosophy. Malaga plays the South American style, huge pressure and rapid attacks when they got the ball. They give the ball possesion to their rivals and should Osasuna fell in this trap they will lose big tonight. Last week Malaga didn't play as good as they played in previous games, but they got a draw in Valladolid. Today Schuster is set to change his midfielders in order to give his team more offensive options. El Hamdaui may start, Pawlowski – who scored an impressive one in Valladolid, will take minutes but most probably will start from the bench again. Osasuna plays in a different way to Rayo and Almeria who recently visited La Rosaleda and left defeated.

Osasuna will set up a defensive wall but their lack of scoring abilities and Malaga's pressure will complicate things for them. Odds on the -1 went up, in fact now the -3/4 is the line here and this makes odds on -1 juicier to take.";;0;-1;2;7;-7,00;3;

Fran Escriba have important missings in defense though, as long as Botia CB* is suspended and Albacar LB is extremely doubt. Sapunaru, a natural side back half, will p[lay in the center of the defense while Albacar's possible missing can be covered by sub Cisma. Escriba has doubts in the middle line as long as Carlos Sánchez returned from suspension. Elche was fielded on a trivote (3 defensive halves) against Real and did very well, while Javi Marquez and Ruben Perez did also great last week in Vigo. Javi Marquez is a great player (former Espanyol's key playmaker) and he has starting giving his fruit to Elche.

Now Carlos returns so Escriba is thinking about fielding a trivote again, but who can really tell? The game is important for ex periquitos Javi Marquez, Corominas and Albacar! Especially Albacar will honor his Espanyol youth teammate Dani Jarque who died a few years ago, in the 21 minute of the game.

Espanyol on the other hand, traveled without Hector Moreno CB* who is supposed to be injured. I don't know if he truly is, but he was dropped 3 weeks ago and in the last two games he performed below average. No more missings for Aguirre who is set to field his best team today. I am going into a more aggresive tactic right now taking Espanyol's level ball (0 or DNB). Elche have built up a nice team but Espanyol are way more experienced and Aguirre knows that he can't lose this one coming from two defeats.

Moreover, the rotations will take place again with one of Griezmann or Vela starting from the bench.

Rayo on the other hand, deserves better fate than table shows. They play at the same level they have been playing during the latter campaign, but their problem is that this season they lack the skills of Baptistao, Chori Dominguez, Piti and Fuego. But they play well enough. They keep the ball possesion and recover wrong balls in the middle line but usually failed by their own defensive mistakes. They did better in Valencia in this matter though and as long as Paco Jemez fix this 'bug' soon, Rayo will start winning points. Today Paco Jemez has a full squad to choose as long as Tito RB**,  Viera FW* (susp), Gálvez CB* (susp) return in the list and the missings are not important.

Sociedad haven't convinced anyone yet and today they are coming from a midweek tough game.

Almeria have played some good games until now but wasted numerous poitns because of their incapability to secure their lead and avoid silly mistakes. The problem about Almeria is that besides a couple of great talents, sub internationals Suso and Vidal, and old fox Soriano, they don't have more quality to show in their squad. Their manager, Francisco, the youngest in La Liga ever, only 35 yo, is enthousiastic but lacking experience just like the rest of the team. No missings today for Almeria.

Sevilla, on the other hand, won comfortably enough against Fraiburg last Thursday with Emery rotating 3-4 players mainly in defense. Sevilla have started recovering confidence and at least at home they can produce nice attractive soccer and put their rivals in high pressure. Almeria is the kind of a team that is set to suffer in Sevilla si ply because they can't defend properly. Here we have to be careful about Sevilla's defense as well as Almeria will play offensively too.

That game was in Sevilla and just before kick off it became known that Valverde is leaving the team. Strange feeling for the players. Anyway, Valencia was struggling two weeks ago but the consecutive wins over Sevilla, Granada, Rayo and Krasnodar made things more tranquil for los Che! You may think that, whao, 4 wins in a row is an amazing achievment, but it's not the whole truth. Valencia suffered in the last three games and despite picking up all points they didn't convince anyone. Moreover, in the last 5 La Liga games, their keeper Alves was announced the MVP of the team... and this tells enough! Now for today Alves remains injured, lost the Krasnodar game as well while important right side back Pereira remains in the list. Rami is in discipline. Postiga and Guaita return.

Athletic on the other hand, have shown two different faces untill now, very strong at home but below average on the road.

Betis on the other hand has confused everybody and it is the rotation policy to blame. Firstly, Ruben Garcia's FW*** missing is huge and despite the fact that Betis covered in some games, their overall scoring record is really poor. 7 goals in 7 games and last season it was 12 at the same time. Pepe Mel has even admitted, we miss Ruben's goals. True, but Betis remain a tough team with strong middle line and defense. Midweek in Rjieka they had the ball, much better than the Croacians, but didn't know what to do with it. No real chances to score and Rjieka went up to some nice counters. Today Pepe Mel will rotate again, 6 changes are expected in refference to the Rjieka game. Ofc this means Betis will be fielded with the regulars, but, this isn't for granted...

Getafe will be fresher. Getafe have also a tough defense to oppose to Betis' defense, while Betis will have to cope with the Croatia trip as well. Level ball on Getafe, I doubt they will lose to Betis today.";;0;0;1,86;6;5,16;2;

In a few days Atletico is playing the derby against leaders Cruzeiro and everybody there are talking about this game and not the today with Ponte Preta. The hosts are a buit tired by the continuous games but their motivation to win is huge and they are facing a rival with many changes and their mind in Cruzeiro plus some key missings of Jo, Ronaldinho, most probably cb captain Réver and more players...

They are playing without a real striker and this is why they have only scored 4 goals in 8 games... Keeper Pacheco (WCQ) and important center back Osede (injured) are the most notable missings. Recreativo Huelva on the other hand, are the leaders and the team with the best attack in the league. They are winning games even without playing in high level.

Their strength lies at home and for today they only have long term missings.

Las Palmas on the other hand, have pure quality in their squad but failed to performe in a decent  level until now. Today they have one important missing, former Osasuna midfielder Masud who is on international duty with Iran while striker Delev (5/0) is with the Bulgarian NT. Las Palmas saved by ...their keepr last week hosting Cordoba.

Regular Bagnack CB (5/0), Babunski MD (4/0), Sanabria FW (2/0), Adama Traoré FW (1/0), are missing with their National squads, while regualrs Dongou FW (5/0) and Sergio Gómez CB (6/0) are out injured. Some other players remain long term sidelines.

Deportivo though, is not any segunda division team. They belong in primera and it is quite interesting to say that they have never lost playing against a 'b team'. In the season 2011-12 when they were playing in segunda again they played against Villarreal B' and Barcelona B' and lost all 4 games. Their squad have pure quality and experience and most of the defense and middle line are the same as last season in La Liga. Depor have the best defense in the division and in the last three games they kept a clean sheet.

Today 4-5 changes are taking place. Depor had the experience to escape victorious Barcelona B' last Sunday adding one more away win in their record. Fernando Vasquez made it clear, they want to advance in the next round of the cup but the league is priority so today noumerous changes will take place in the starting XI. Four players from the B' team are sure to start (this is the max the association allows in a cup game) and many sub players are also taking the nod. Only three professionals are going to start today. Depor played in the same way in the previous cup round and surprisingly eliminated Cordoba in the penalties.

Jaen want this game more than Deportivo who have set the league as top priority. Less changes for the hosts and a quite interesting stage of form makes this choice on their 'Draw No Bet' reasonable.

Mascherano is also back but the FIFA virous is to blame for Pique and Alexis losing the trip to Navarra. Dani Alves was dropped as well while Jordi Alba is the only missing through injury.

On the other hand, Osasuna have Roberto Torres, Miguel Flaño and Jon Echaide back in the squad but Javi Gracia will have to do without one of the 6 players he used in every single game since his arrival, Armenteros. Osasuna have been doing remarkably well in recent games and this shows that Javi Gracia work grows fruits. The performance in Atletico Madrid against one of the best teams in Europe, didn't come incidentally with the next games against Levante and Malaga confirming the excellent form of los rojillos. Of course Osasuna lost against Levante but they were at least impressive (mainly in the 1st part) achieving 70% ball possesion and 20 scoring attempts! The Malaga game came right after with Osasuna obtaining a well deserved away win.

Now it's Barcelona coming in Pamplona and is set to suffer just like they suffered last year and the year before and before that. In the last 10 years history shows 2 wins for Osasuna, 4 draws and 5 wins for Barcelona who only in 2010 managed to win with more than 2 goals there! Last year it was Messi's late double (76', 80') to make a hard fought 1-2 win for Barcelona and two years ago guess what, Osasuna won it by 3-2! The FIFA virous from the international games the El Sadar history, the great Osasuna form and their greater need of points, makes this bet takeable.

Should they win in Mestalla they will get into the elite that managed to win there for three times in a row! Is this possible? Well, Sociedad have been underperforming this season and it is obviously has to do with the CL. Real weren't used to play in two competitions in high level and the rotation policy – necessary in a situation like this – was one of the reasons for league underperforming. The good about this is that Sociedad showed signs of improvment in their last two games in Leverkusen and Vallecas but still they were succumped in late and hursh defeats. Captain and Javi Prieto is back after losing the last three games on the sidelines but he is expecting to start in the bench while Dani Estrada, Esteban Granero and Diego Ifrán are long term missings. Zurutuza is fit to take a starting up role in the midlle line.

On the other hand, Valancia was awesome at last and they did so in Bilbao! Los Che had a winning run but their performances were mostly poor and goalkeeper Alves was their savior and MVP. In their last game they recovered confidence and deserved more than a draw in Bilbao. Who knows. Maybe the players wanted to revenge their former manager Valverde for announcing his decision to leave the club just before the crucial last game of the season in May? Nobody can tell. Well, Rami was forced out. He signed on loan in AC Milan with a purchase option. This sounds like a solid decision from the club to punish the riot ones but it also makes a defender less for Valencia who remain without their savior Alves. Good news about right back Pereira who recovered his injury and return to cover in the right back. Anyway, Sociedad plays on Wednesday in Man Utd, while Valencia host St Gallen on Thursday.

Both will have an eye on these games but after a two-week break I am not expecting anything less than a hard fight in Mestalla. And I have eyes for both outsiders in the upcoming UEFA games... (St Gallen is a very nice team).

The visitors on the other hand, are aiming for the 2nd place this season which means a straight promotion in primera division. Recre gave us a nice away win in Madrid last week, BUT, they deserved nothing out of that game. Maybe the draw. They got an early lead by a huge keeping mistake from Castilla and during the game their keeper saved a penalty to keep their lead. Castilla got the equalizer before half time, they had a shot in the bar which is still shaking and in a counter Recre scored the 1-2 from offside position. The problem for Recre is that the Castilla game wasn't the only one they were lucky. In their last three games Recre deserved very little but got everything, 3 wins, and we had this in mind taking their outstanding odds in Castilla.

On the contrary, Lugo have been performing very well in the season confirming their goal to chase the 2nd place and the promotion to primera. Their only recent defeat came in Madrid against Castilla in a game they didn't even bother getting in the field... Some rumors were surfaced about that game.

Anyway, this is a hot game between the leaders Recre and the team with the best form, Lugo. No important missings for none, odds are amazing high for Lugo. In the midweek Recre won but both played with numerous changes.";;0;0,5;2,02;7;7,14;2;

On the other hand Asteras have started playing better and deserved much more in their last game which finished in a bitter injury time draw. Asteras greater advantage here is their history stats against PAOK.

This obviously can't work and the underperforming of several key players during the latter campaign was the reason for an almost relegation in segunda. Augusto is definitely out, Celta will miss him. Levante on the other hand, have start roling. Baba is doing a much better job here than in Sevilla while Xumerta, Diop and Ruben Garcia are the revelations untill now.

Levante can defend like very few teams in the league and launch their counters with the new man in command,former Elche winger, Xumerta. No new missings for Caparros. Odds on Levante are going up.

Austria were left without a win for 10 games in all competitions last weekend and they should feel lucky for not losing to Ried. Atletico lost fairly enough to Espanyol in Barcelona and the worst came after the game with Diego Costa's injury. The Brazilean striker made it in the squad but he is serious doubt today and most probably won't play a minute.

He served the 4 games ban he was carrying from the last season though. Striker Baptistao is also out injured. Good news for another striker, Adrian, who recovered his injury and returned back, with David Villa starting in the peak of the attack today. Austria have regular midfielders Alexander Gorgon and Alexander Grünwald still unavailable. Creative midfielder Stankovic and winger Jun are back in the squad.

There is a huge gap in quality here and Atletico should take this game seriously enough after the Espanyol defeat.

Celta have only one win in the season and comes from 5 defeats in the last 6 games a terrible record that moved those from Vigo second from bottom in the table.

Still Celta, doesn't deserve that place as long as their performances are not as bad as table ranking shows. Especially last week against Levante at home they fully dominated the game but lost is in the oinly one shot attempt from the visitors. Rafinha OH** (susp) and Krohn-Delhi FW** are missing today, Augusto FW** is back though to cover.

On the other hand Malaga are also in a bit downtrent, not like Celta, but only one win in the last 5 is not the best possible. Schuster can not count on his two center backs today, Angeleri and Sergio Sanchez, so he will have to mix his defense. Polish offensive midfielder Pawlowski got the call.

I fought a lot about this game. Malaga is also in need of the points and Celta is not quite the opposite Malaga can be afraid off. Celta plays a 4-3-3 mostly with their mind in attack. Luis Enrique has learnt the Barcelona style and this is the style he want to give to Celta. Unfortunately this style is not the most suitable to play Malaga on the road. Almeria and Rayo were thrashed in Rosaleda trying to play offensively, Osasuna on the contrary won. Moreover, Celta is not the best team when traveling away from Vigo and today Rafinha will make a huge missing in the center of the field.

Elche is in excellent state of form, something pretty much expected as long as los Ilicitanos have some quality to show in their squad plus experience from players who played big part in primera division in recent years, while Granada are doing worst game by game. Most probably the injury of Dani Benitez and Piti and the low form of El Arabi, Riki and Recio, among others, are the main reason for the poor performances of Granada. Today Benitez remain out while Piti, who recently recovered his injury, is missing again. Piti was the MVP coming from the bench last week but he is missing today.

Elche on the other hand, have doubts in the left full back with regular Albacar extremely doubt and Domiongo Cisma missing through suspension. Fran Escriba will cover with one midfielder in case that Albacar doesn't make it.

Elche's greater advantage today is the excellent form of almost all their regulars, especially their midfielders and center back defenders! This means that they will hardly leave any room for counters to Granada while Coro and co in attack, who are in great form as well, will take over the scoring job.

Sociedad is playing the Basque derby against Osauna at the weekend and then are hosting Man Utd in the CL! Valladolid is a nut hard to break and haven't lost at home to Sociedad since 2002. Actually they didn't win more than once in three games since then, so history stats have no much to do today.

What is for granted is that Valladolid is going to play at their 100% something pretty uncertain for Sociedad who have a mountian to climb in the next days.";;0;0;2;7;7;2;

Ok Ramos has played in this position but it was a long time ago in his first Sevilla steps. Real did not enter the field in this period and reacted only after Ancelotti went to fix things after the restart placing Benzema upfront and Illara in the middle. Real played very well in the 2nd and deserved more. Anyway, Ancelotti will make things better this time and he has no excuses as long as he has a full squad to chose, Xabi Alonso is finally available!

Sevilla beat 10-men Osasuna at home, they were better but when they travel in Madrid they usually lose before kick off. It's their mentality and today it will be the urgent need of a convincing win from Real as well. Center back Cala served his ban, good news, but Marin CMD*, Trochowski MD*, Fazio CB, Cheryshev, Rusescu FW (new missing) remain out.

As mentioned above, Sevilla lose in Madrid easy enough and today Ancelotti undergoes a hard test in from of the Madrid crowd. Blatter apologized for stating that he prefers Messi than Ronaldo so the road is open for Real to win this in an emphatic way.";;0;-2;2,02;7;7,14;2;

Pepe Mel introduced many changes in the lineup against Atletico Madrid and Betis performed one of their worst games in the season losing by 5-0. The weird thing about the huge rotation was that Betis have already been facing enough obligated missings through injuries but besides that Mel decided to rotate the team. For today Betis are facing more obligated missings through injuries, as long as  Sara GLK*, Lolo Reyes CMD*, Salva Sevilla CMD*, Nosa CMD***, Paulao CB*, Rubιn Castro FW*** (injured), Didac LB (dec tec) are out. There is good news for Amaya CB*, Xavi Torres CMD, Verdϊ OH*** who are back after losing the last one, but the missings remain too many and important. Pepe Mel will be able to compose a decent lineup but he will have no alternatives coming from the bench.

On the other hand, Levante traveled almost in full power. Crhis Lel RB* has been fully recovered but Ruben MD* failed to be fully fit with Austrian international Ivanschitz MD picking up the nod to replace him.  Levante are in excellent form and haven't lost away from home since the opening day in Barcelona. The truth is that Levante have been pretty lucky recently especially picking up points in Celta and Osasuna, but they have also performed some great games as the one against Real Madrid. History stats have mixed results, one time its Betis win then Levante.

Anyway, Levante are in better form and momentum. They should grab one point at least here.";;0;0,5;1,94;7;6,58;2;

In the midweek they played very well against Sociedad and grabbed a deserved draw wasting a huge opportunity to win in the 90 with the wasted penatly of Ebert. Osorio didn't manage to recover for the midweek game but he is ready now. Manucho, Víctor Pérez, Óscar and Heinz remain out.

Almeria are doing very well either and this time they were rewarded a huge win in Mestalla! Even though in recent games, Almeria haven't been as good as they have been in the opening 10 games of the season they stood up and turned over the game against Valencia winning crucial points and gaining confidence. That was a massive morale boost for their young manager Francisco. The younger coach in primera, only 35 yo, enjoys full respect of his players who dedicated the win to him! Francisco has a full squad in his disposal.

Almeria is a familly but this barely has to do with facing and winning Valladolid today.  Valencia was just terrible the other day, couldn't change two passes in the field, Almeria punished them, well done. This game is complitely different and Valladolid makes a tougher rival especially now that they will play their counter attacking style.";;0;0,25;2;7;-7;3;

In the last three meeting of these two in San Sebastian only one goal was scored 3 years ago and that was a 1-0 home win for Real! Of course the 'under' is the most common outcome in Pamplona as well as in 20 games between these two since 2000,  15 'u2.5' were resulted!

Now for the game. Real Sociedad are coming from the cold shower and the close defeat in Valladolid in a game they took a 0-2 lead but were drawn and almost lost it in the end. Their keeper Bravo saved a penalty in the 90 minute to keep the draw for Sociedad who wasn't better than Valladolid but had Griezmann and Carlos Vela plus their defense (in most of the game) in very good day. Real have a full squad, Inigo and Elustodo are back. Arrasate will drop two players before kick off and he will introduce some changes not overdo though in order to keep his team fresh ahead of  Man Utd visit in Anoeta on Tuesday.

Osasuna on the other hand, are coming into the derby with the morale sky high.By winning Rayo at home Osasuna got off the danger zone and now they have a full squad to play Real. Since manager Xavi Gracia arrived two months ago he made his tests and picked up the basic core of the team, 6 players. Armenteros MD** and Damia DF** who are back in the team for this game are included in this core. Real will definitely have Man Utd in their minds and Arrasate will introduce a couple of changes in the XI.

Osasuna are in very good form and they will be better prepared and focused for this game. Traditionally they are picking points in San Sebastian so +3/4 at these odds looks nice.";;0;1;2;6;-6;3;

Celta lost at home to Barcelona by 3-0 but what Sevilla sustained in the Bernabeu was really humilliated, 7 goals against! They scored three though and this is because of their gardian angel Rakitic who was announced MVP for 6th time in the last 7 games of the team he was fit to play, losing one through injury! Cala CB* is out again,  Iborra DH and Reyes MD are not important missings. Cristóforo CMD, Trochowski CMD, Rusescu FW and Pareja CB are back, nothing sticky.

Celta recovered confidence by their stanning win in Malaga and this was the morale boost the team was urgently needed. The team have been playing pretty well in most of thier games but were failing to show results. The game against Barcelona was a parenthesis and now with a full squad, only long term are the missings, Celta are going for their 2nd on the road bombing. Can they?

Of course they can, at least to win the +1 handicap. Celta have nothing to envy of Sevilla, on the contrary they have even better quality players in many positions. Former spanish international Oubina has nothing to envy of Mbia and surely he is much better than Iborra, Nolito and Augusto, Portugal and Argetina internationals are definitely better values against the young Sevilla wingers Jairo and Vitolo! The last season top scorer in segunda Charles is at least at the same level to Bacca and Gameiro. Rafinha and Alex Lopez have giant Rakitic against them while Sevilla looks sharper in the full backs especially with wonder buy Alberto! In the goalie Celta have their guardian angel Yoel to make them feel really secure in the back. No need to mention the huge gap in the managers. Celta's Luis Enrique has his Barca style philosophy to show against the long balls attacking style (?) of Emery Unai...

So all in all, it is going to be a close affair. Odds make this worthy to take.";;0;1;1,96;7;6,72;2;

The last three consecutive defeats against Sociedad, Villarreal and most recently rock bottom Almeria put Valencia and their manager in a quite complicated situation and the ghost of Rami is appearing in Mestalla lockerooms. Rami stated among other towards Djukic a few weeks ago “we 'll see who will be in the team in May”... Rami was sent out of the club and Valencia surprisingly started picking up points. Now it's Djukic time to go and will most probably pack his stuff. Valencia won some games recently but only in Bilbao they deserved more. Justice have been done in the last three with Valencia showing unable to change two passes in the field. Today Djukic will have to do without his two side full backs  (Pereira, Guardado) while left side midfielder Feghouli, who enjoyed regularity in the XI recently, is also missing through injury. Banega OH*** is coming back after serving his ban.

On the other hand, Getafe are doing pretty well recently. Key players Pedro Leon among them recovered their best version so the team is rolling especially at home. In their last home game they performed brilliantly and only lost to Bilbao in details while they were lucky enough to win in Villarreal in the midweek. Key striker Colunga FW** remains out for 2nd game but there is good news for Arroyo RB* who has been fully recovered after losing the last two. Valencia is struggling and today los Che will have their two full backs plus Feghouli missing.

Just before that Jaen was brilliant in Gijon and deserved more than the 1-1 draw against one of promotion candidates Sporting, while another win recently was achieved for the Andalusians at home against Alcorcorn. This time it is Mirandes visiting 'La Victoria' with the Basques being the worst team from all the above Jaen have already won recently. More over Mirandes traveled with missings. Ruiz de Galarreta MD (11/1), Muneta MD (4/0) and Koikili DF (7/0) are new missings while Prieto GLK (5/0) and Iriome MD (7/1) remain sidelines. Promising midfielder on loan from Bilbao  Ruiz de Galarreta got injured in the midweek and is losing the rest of the season. Hard blow. Jaen on the other hand have key players back.

Tenerife remains into the danger zone but with a win today they will most probably get off sending Alaves occupying a hot place there! Alaves have won some points but just like the opposite to Tenerife they had plenty of luck on their side!

These two are crossing their swords today in a game 'without tomorrow' for Juve while los galacticos feel much safer with 9 points form the opening three games in the group B.

When I started gathering the news for this game, I wasn't any confident at all, about backing either teams but when I checked the odds, I fell off my chair...!! Real Madrid is the underdog here? Why? Juve are doing pretty well in Serie A' and have built up a nice team again after their Serie B' adventure, but this season in the CL they haven't convinced anybody. The dropped points in Copenhagen and at home to Galata why are they such a favorite against Madrid?

Ok, Real have been struggling in defense and today Carlos Ancelotti introducing changes. Marcelo is taking Coentrao's place and Iker Casillas in the posts and moreover Xabi Alonso replacing Illaramenti. What I see from these changes is that Real will be fielded with their stronger version because Marcelo, Alonso and Casillas are better than Coentrao, Illara and Lopez. So what I expect here is a solid Madrid outfit eager to answer the whispering about their defense to play against Juve who's manager haven't decided yet if he fields up a 3-4-3 or a 4-3-3 formation, with Chiellini CB (10/1 - susp), Lichtsteiner DF (5/0), Vučinić FW (5/1) missing, and with their top scorer in Serie A' Carlos Tévez without a single goal in the European competitions since 2009, four and a half years now... And all these with Real Madrid is great odds. I don't know. I think this is tempting enough and I am taking the Real's level ball.

I really can't tell why ppl keep betting in Juve... Odds on Real are going up! Only the motivation thing? Maybe they believe Ancelotti will do any favors? … Amazing.";;0;0;2,26;6;;1;

Arda and Mario remain out, Simeone may give a rest to David Villa but he may not as long as el Guaje is in excellent form. Austria without their manager who is suspended and some others...

It isn't about the winner of course but about the handicap.

The squad is limited, the injuries too many, some decisions of Pepe Mell seems weird, but the conclusion is that the team isn't functionable. Mell has his plan to prepare a team able to stand in two competitions but I am afraid the squad isn't responding properly. Today Betis are missing their three regullar center backs, plus three midfielders, plus their key striker {Perquis CB*, Amaya CB*, Lolo Reyes CMD*, Salva Sevilla CMD*, Paulao CB*, Rubιn Castro FW*** (injured), Chica, Matilla (last 2 not registered in EL)}

Anyway, the starting XI will be the same who faced Malaga on Sunday plus defender Caro and striker Braian Rodríguez. Jorge Molina FW** will start to the bench, Nosa CMD*** as well because he isn't ready yet. Betis plays Barcelona at the weekend but Pepe Mel said it will be a nonsense to rest players to play Barcelona. He will field his best possible lineup.

In Guimaraes there are a couple of missings in the team but the most important is that Guimaraes is a mediocre team in Portugal and even with those missings Betis can not be considered as the underdog. Betis was n't bad at all in the last two games. Against Levante they were much better playing with 10 players for most of the game while in Malaga they played very well and they received the 3-2 in injury time after wasting some good opportunities to get the winner on their own in the last quarter of the game.

Osasuna have Gracia on the bench who was the man who led Almeria in the primera division last season but was sucked right after the end of the cmpaing with Fransisco coming as his replacement! Gracia is seeking for revence, no doubt about that, that most important is to win points for Osasuna who ruined the recent ewll performances by the exit in Anoeta and the 5-0 defeat to Sociedad.

Osasuna at home is a strong team, too strong for every team in La Liga with Barcelona struggling and failing to win  there 2-3 weeks ago (0-0). Key midfielder Armenteros, one of Gracia core-players is back at last while Miguel Flanio will cover for Loties in the center of defence. Almeria traveled with key missings as long as winger Suso and defensive midfielder Verza are suspended. This will be the first game Verza is losing in the season and his missing will be important. Without theses missings, Almeria could well enjoy some decent possibilities to escape El Sadar with point(s).

Valencia not only won two games they 'won' two players, Sergio Canales and Piatti. The 'golden boy' performed at his standards at last but it wasn't his fault. Canales has been struggling with many serious injuries since he joined Valencia but as it seems he is now back! His passes and set pieces (two posts in St Gallen) are one of a kind and at last, Valencia found a creative midfielder! The other player, Piatti, was set to leave in the summer out of Djukic' plans but he got injured in the last day of the tranfers and stayed in Valencia. He worked hard since and he took the nod to start in the last two games where Djukic was playing his head! Piatti did great, especially in St Gallen where he wasn't set to start (which means he is supposed to be a starter in the league, yes) but stepped in in 2' replacing injured Fede and performed brilliandly!! Jonas is out but Jonas was benched in Getafe from Djukic and after losing a penalty in St Gallen he was injured (?) in 26'. He is 'supposed' to be injured today... Who knows? Piatti has won the battle against Jonas and even if he was fit, Piatti would start! Valladolid on the other hand, are as  bad as Levante is when traveling away from home.

(Yesterday Levante had 3 shots on target, two in the same opportunity the 2nd wend in. If Athletic didn't have played like pussies in the 1st part, it could have been an easy win for the hosts).

Anyway, Valladolid have 19 shots on target in 6 away games so far and 8 of these shots were against crazy offensive minded Rayo in a game they lost 3-0 and had nothing to lose but going forward and shot. Especially in some of their exits Valladolid had no ambitious at all. Now they should be a bit more motivated as they play a big rival and facing their former manager Djukic who did amazing work there in the last years! Of course Djukic has the upped hand today as long as he perfectly knows his former players and their style of play which didn't change a bit since JIM arrived!

So this is a handicap for Valladolid today but even bigger worries for JIM make the missing of key fowrad Ebert FW*** through suspension. For the first time in the season I believe in Valencia. Djukic was one of my favorite managers last year, he is motivated enough today to win against their former players while Canales and Piatti and young striker Alcacer who has been winning the battle for a starting up role against Postiga, will give their 110%.";;0;-1;2;8;-8;3;

Messi's missing can be covered, indeed, by Neymar, but Valdes' missing between the posts is huge. Valdes have been the reason for Barcelona not conceding crucial and silly goals in recent years and has been the man throwing many of my bets against los cules in the recycle bin.

Mirandes are since some weeks without influential midfielder Ruiz de Galarreta while for today experience mid and one of their key players, Iván Agustín (13/0) is suspended. Corral DF (10/0) and  Muneta MD (4/0) are also missing. Cordoba, on the other hand, have Janse DF (10/0) and Xisco FW (12/4) unavailable, but they recover midfielders Pedro Sánchez MD (12/1) who served his ban last week and Pelayo MD (7/0) who is totally fit after losing the last three in the sidelines.

In the penultimum game in the last season, Mirandes visited Cordoba and with the away win by 1-2 they mathematically sealed their permanence in segunda dvision. Cordoba had nothing to fight for.This is defeinitely not a pay back but the form and the missings are pointing towards the visitors!";;0;0;2;6;-6;3;
1;0;0;24.11.13;24.11.13;Mantis;Levante;es;Villarreal;es;Over;Spanish La Liga;;"Region derby in the Valencia province with at least 2000 Villarreal supporters set to occupy the Ciudad de Valencia today! Getting straight to the point, I have to mention that Levante is below average or at least below what we were expected. Joaquin Caparros has built up a defensive wall without any will of creativeness and ottacking football. The numbers away from home are outstanding poor (38% ball posession, 10 attempts av, 3,5 on target av) while their home stats are not any better (40% ball posession, 12,5 attempts av, 4,8 on target av). Against Villarreal they will succumbed to an even lower ball possesion and will allow even more shots on their goal. We keep that in mind.

Secondly, Levante have a problem in the right full back position. Pedro Lopez is suspended, Hector Rodas who played there many times in the season, is injured, and the other option Chris Lell is a complicated situation. Caparros told him late enough that he don't need him in the team, and in the midweek Lell put his manager and team under critisism. He wasn't receive any discipline though (!) and he is featuring now in the squad. Nobody knows if he starts, but even if he does he won't bleed for his manager...

Villarreal without important Giovanni Dos Santos for precautious, but Giovanni was missing just before the break with Villarreal performing brilliandly against Atletico Madrid! Everything's pointing towards Villarreal here but I will take the o2,25 instead of the -0,25 why odds around 2,0 are pretty tempting.

Betis are rock bottom and need deadly to win some confidence, where will they find a better opportunity than the derby, while Sevilla seem to recover confidence by their last win in Espanyol. If there wasn't any break this will be an even more confident shot on Betis who have started playing much better in their last games excactly the opposite to Sevilla who managed to beat only struggling Espanyol. Celta won three weeks ago in this ground and Real had netted 7 on Sevilla...

On the contrary Betis was impressive – even with 10 players – against Levante (0-0 H), should have won in Malaga but succumbed in an injury time 3-2 defeat and while you were expected Betis to start scoring against Barcelona in their last game, los Catalans scored 4 instead! Amazing... Betis was excellent in that game too. Now today, Betis recovers many first choice players plus key striker Ruben Castro who will most probably start to the bench and get his opportunity during the game. This is good news of course, Betis will recover confidence only with Castro in the squad and I give them better option today in Sevilla than offer odds represents.";;0;0,75;2;7;-7;3;
1;0;0;26.11.13;26.11.13;Mantis;Zenit;es;Atletico;es;Zenit;Spanish La Liga;;"Zenit ruined the good impressions of the second half in Porto with their domestic performances with the last home defeat against Rostov and the away in Spartak following the Porto 1-1 draw. Despite their terrible form in the Russian league they have shown that they can play some nice soccer and today according to their reports, Zenit is playing the greatest game of their recent history! There are some missings but as long as Shirokov (9/5) and Kerzhakov (11/4) have been fully recovered we can assume that there are not important missings.

On the other hand, Atletico with 4/4 wins in the group G, have nothing to play for and they traveled in St. Petersburg with numerous missings. Diego Simeone decided to go into huge rotations in order to keep his squad fresh so he left in Madrid key players like Godin, Filipe Luis, Tiago, Mario Suarez, Arda Turan, Diego Costa and David Villa. On the contrary, Cebolla made it to catch up with the team in Russia after watching his new born kid yesterday, while some youngsters from B team are included in the squad.

Now, what are we going to bet here? Atletico is by far the better team, BUT, today half of this team will get in the field. It isn't only one or two players who are missing, there are too many and important missings. This definitely changes the rules of the game making Atletico a much 'weaker team' than we know. Plus the fact that Zenit is playing the most important game of their history...

I think that Zenit will take what they need today, but it is a bit scary to bet against Atletico at these odds. Last weekend I didn't only skip Atletico -1,5 but I even though about taking Getafe +1,75 and that was because Diego Costa wasn't set to start... Atletico served 7... landing my on earth, cause you can not change your mind because of one player missin. Anyway, this is a completely different game and situation. Zenit -0,25 is my call.

Things are getting more difficult for Malaga who have Portillo MD** added in the already missings of El Hamdaoui FW** and Santa Cruz FW**. Portillo has been under some excellent games in the season and he got the nick “new Isco”.

Getafe and Levante are crossing swords eager to bounce back after the recent humiliating defeats suffered from Atletico and Villarreal respectively. Both are in low form and have only won one game, drawing another and losing three in the last five. The different between Getafe and Levante is that at least Getafe have shown a pretty nice face especially in some home games while Levante is awful in overall with only a couple of exceptions.

On the road Levante are really poor and have to show only 38% ball possesion and 3,5 shots on target in average while they allow 62% possesion, 17 shots against, 7,5 of them on target. More over, and this is the main reason for this pick, today Levante traveled without their guardian angel Keylor Navas GLK** who is suspended, plus the new injury tied Chris Lell, David Navarro CB*,  Ivanschitz MD* and Babá Diawara FW**! Notable missings for already weak on the road Levante. Getafe have Varela RB* suspended but as long as Arroyo is fit there is no problem.";;0;win;1,9;7;6,3;3;

Atletico on the other hand, are coming into this game following a midweek long trip to Russia and a draw to Zenit but with the huge motivation of the 1st place in the table as long as los Cholchoneros manage to pick up a win today!

Elche recovers key players who lost the last game due to suspension and contract clause's, Aaron, Ruben, Gil and only Manu remains out. Atletico on the other hand have Godín, Filipe, Arda Turan, Tiago, Diego Costa, Villa who didn't travel in Russin in order to take a rest, back in the squad so Simeone is able to field his 'once de gala' , his best XI, as long as only Mario is missing. The quality difference is improtant here.

Elche is a fine team to play average teams in La Liga. They are not going to relegate, this was my opinion before season starts as well, but against Atletico is it really difficult to snitch a result. Elche suffered big against Valencia last week and only to Valencia's struggling defense they won the game. They suffered big against Villarreal and Granada in the other two recent home games too. Atletico have the chance to move in top of the division today. The numbers are in favor too.";;0;-1;1,94;7;6,58;2;

In this period Sociedad has won 4 times games from the Mestalla while they have only lost one game their visit in the Bernabeu. Last week they received a huge morale boost by turning over the 1-3 against Celta in a heroic Vela-win by 4-3 and now they are up to keep their successful run in the league. Vela scored 4 goals last week and he is gathering all the eyes today. Important Markel and Carlos are back in the team, where only Zurutuza, Chori and Angel are missing.

Espanyol broke the bad gust of wind in the last 6 games by a solid win in Vallecano by 1-4. They were favored by the route of the game though as long as Rayo got a red and Espanyol won a penalty and that was all. Thievy who usually comes as a sub but is really helpful and skilfu is out, recently appointed as regular mid Lanzarote missed a midweek training session and is suspended.

Both are coming from bad results, but both have faith to their managers, Pepe Mel and Paco Jemez respectively. For Betis, this is the most important of the season, their terrible run can't last any longer. The good point is that Betis have key players fit after a very long time and even though there are still missings, these are not that important. Ruben Castro and Jorge Molina will start together in attack for the first time in the season while several regulars were rested in the midweek missing the trip to Lyon. With the exception of the Sevilla derby and the 4-0 hursh defeat to Sevilla FC, Betis played some nice games recently showing signs of improvement.

Rayo on the other hand are playing an offensive minded game that some times turns against them just like last week in the 1-4 home defeat to Espanyol. For another one game Rayo is facing important missings in defense as long as Martinez the keeper is a new loss, while CBs Galvez, Rodri and Ze Castro remains out. The good about Rayo is the recent history which has 4 wins to show in the last 2 years against Betis and the bad for Betis is that these game were played with Pepe Mel and Paco Jemez in the benches of the teams meaning that Rayo's Paco has taken control over Mel. So, it sounds safer to take the over2.5 here 'trusting' Betis lousy defense and their need of points, against Rayo's need of points as well plus their missings in defense and fearless attack.";;0;2,5;1,8;6;4,8;2;

Sevilla had some nice games recently, the big Andalusian derby against Betis included, BUT, they were favored by the circumstances as well in that game. They took an early lead and just before half time Betis were reduced to 10 and right after Sevilla made the 2-0. Reyes was their best player, he does it once a season in the derby against Sevilla... In the midweek Sevilla were succumbed in a home late draw to Estoril. No missings.

Granada is a team I like much especially at home. They can play nice soccer. Today they have only one but notable missing, as suspended Iturra was in great form recently.

He stated that Di Mateo won the CL with Chelsea taking over as a limited-time manager why he have to fail? Tamudo is the most importatn missing.

Mirandes on the other hand, started terrible the game against Cordoba but after getting away with the 0-2 against they took over and turned the game over winning by 3-1. Still, in that game Mirandes lost two more of their regular midfielders, Mujica (14/3) and Pablo Infande (10/3), and with De Galarreta (11/1) missing in the last month, they are set to play with a brant new middle line.

There are some missing in defense, should make no worries, another midfielder was surprisingly dropped but he didn't play last week too, most probably he has a think with mister Sadoval. Regulr winger Fraile retrurns and this is good.

On the other hand, weak on the road Alco traveled in one of the toughest grounds in Spain in Gijon with key missings. Last week Alco was held in a goal-less draw against Murcia but their players saw 3 red cards their manager as well! So today, mister Alvarez will be in the stands while regular right full back Nagore (10/0), influential midfielder Mora (15/0) and defensive half Martinez (6/0) did not travel with the team. Forwards Cristian (14/1) recovered in time but Alco will have to cope with the key missing of their head and sould in the center of the field, Mora.

Tenerife didn't play well in Girona but they managed to got an early lead and then equalize the 2-1 Girona had managed to turn over in the start of the 2nd part. It was pretty much expected, Tenerife had eyes for the derby...On the opther hand, Las Palmas suffered at home and succumbed to a defeat against Zaragoza. They dominated almost the entire game but failed to convert their opportunities to goals proving once again that Apono's missing is of vital importance. Apono will be missing another 5 games and today important left midfielder Masoud is suspended as well (his sanction confirmed a few minutes ago). More over, offensive half Tana (11/1) is injured, regular center back D Garcia (11/0) remains out and important center back Deivid is extremely doubt, almost ruled out.The missings and the form pointing out for a win for Tenerife is the derby tonight.

Girona are not something spectacular. They struggled against Tenerife to get a 2-2 home draw and in their last away game in Zaragoza they played deep shit. Girona welcomes Getafe on Saturday in the cup (we have cup weekend in Spain!) and even though they say that they are thinking only about Castilla playing against a top division team and advancing to the next stage can bring you nice income.

Celta entertains Athletic de Bilbao with both coming from great victories in the league, Celta broke the bad gust of wind at home and Athletic beat Barcelona!

Luis Enrique made it clear that the league is the top priority for Celta so today he is goind to produce several changes in his line up against Athletic. Winger Augusto, key defensive midfielder Fontas and left full back Jon Aurtenetxe, are losing the game injured and the last one for contract clause respectively while Enrique is set to give rest to regulars like right full back Hugo Mallo, offensive mid Rafinha, striker Charles and keeper Yoel.

On the other hand, Athletic is always interested in this competition as long as they have the most trophies than any other team except Barcelona.  Ernesto Valverde, traveled in Balaídos with a full squad, Aduriz returned from sanction in the league so Athletic will be fielded just like last Sunday when they beat Barcelona at the San Mames, plus Aduriz! Herrerín, Iraola, Gurpegi, San José, Balenziaga, Iturraspe, Beñat, De Marcos, Susaeta, Aduriz and Muniain.

Celta will field a competitive side but there are going to be about 6-7 changes in the lineup in reference to their stronger version in the league. Athletic are interesting in the cup. Yesterday late at night odds on Athletic Draw No Bet, were over 2,0 euros but between 4:00 and 5:00 there were huge money invested in them so it dived as deep as 1,88 at the time being... 10bet has this line offered at 1,96, I don't even know if it real but it is a fine price to take.

Cruzeiro wil be fielded with a whole new line up today just like in the last 1-2 games. Only one players of the first team is present the others are substitues.

This is the last home game for Flamengo and their manager have signed a new contract it should be an oportunity to celebrate and give their supporters a fiesta.

In the midweek La Liga teams had a break but Alcorcon had to play in Ponfe where they won away by 1-2. It was a great week after the 2-2 in Gijon, Alco won in Ponferadina and reached to a 5 games unbeaten run. Today they will play in a mixed squad, no changes announced or confirmed except of the known ones of center back Nagore (10/0) and  midfielder Sanz (14/0).

Granada deserved more in their last league game against Sevilla at home where it seems that something 's going wrong. On the road Granada finds better room to launch their counters and today I really can't tell why Alcorcon is such a favorite against Granada here as long as the visitors have an almost full squad in their disposal. Only striker El Arabi and center back Diakhate were left our to take some rest the other missings are usuall drops and make no difference to the team. Moreover Iturra who lost the last league game suspended returns in the squad. He is the most inform midfielder Granada can allow nowadays.

OUT: Dimitrievski, Fatau, Álvaro García, El Arabi, Diakhaté, Dani Benitez (dec tec), Migue García, Campos Toro (injured)

Lucas Alcaraz made it clear: “Who ever lacks motivation against Alcorcon he will be dropped in the next league game against Rayo Vallecano”. Straight and simply! Only Carnezis in the goalie was confirmed and in the rest of the field who ever plays makes no big difference.

The momentum is calling for Granada here especielly as long as they are the underdog!

The squad is the same as the one that traveled in Huelva four days ago and only regular striker Jona FW** is a doubt.

Espanyol were fielded in a ultra defensive style at the Camp Nou a month ago and they did really well only lost by 1-0. Will they try the same today or Aguirre will test a formation ahead of the Almeria exit next week? Who knows, but what ever comes what is for granted is that Real Jaen will be the more enthousiastic and motivated team in the field.

Riejka on the other hand, traveled in Andalusia with complitely lack of motivation in the ranking of the group I. They are out and today their coach will rotate a bit since the hot game against Haiduk is coming at the weekend.

Betis do have hopes for the top spot but it is also the home debut of their new manager and this makes the shot of them realistic. Betis needs a confidence boost, Garrido and the players as well, they should win against unmotivated Reijka and go in San Sebastian with their morale high.

Osasuna had a full week to prepare the game, Real had to travel in Denmark to play Kopenghagen, where all the squad was included so some fatigue may occur and maybe lack of freshness. Don't forget that Christmas vacations are coming and the continuous games don't give the best motivation to many teams. Anyway, Real traveled in Pamplona in full power, Khedira, Coentrao and Varane are missing Ramos is back while Osasuna have two missings, not really important, 38years old Punal is suspended, out of form mid De La Cuevas is injured. Last week Osasuna got a massive morale boost in Malaga playing with many changes. I doubt that fatigue tied Maadrid will be able to win the -2 goals handicap here.";;0;2;1,81;6;4,86;2;

It was a confident boost as long as Rayo have been under bad results recently especially in front tof their home supporters. Rayo's philosophy doesn't change it is the offensive-attractive football and some effords of Paco Jemez to give his defense a solidness din't grow fruits as expected.

Granada is a team with plenty of quality. They played with changes in Alcorcon last week and they won in style by 0-2. The players who came in don't have more to envy to the regulars. Key midfielder Iturra returns in the league and on the contrary Rayo is missing their best player and revelation of the season, defensive mid Saul. In the other game Saul was missing Rayo lost at home to Valladolid by 0-3, it will be a huge loss in the center of the field against solid Granada offensive line today.";;0;0,25;2,01;7;7,07;2;

Key striker Rodri remains out, Oscar Diaz did a really good job replacing him, no other missings the players who were rested in the cup, Verza, Suso, Torsiglieri, Nelson, Dubarbier, return in the XI. Espanyol on the other hand, traveled in full squad as long as key forward Sergio Garcia, striker Cordoba and center back Moreno have been recovered after losing the midweek trip to Jaen (2-2 cup draw).

I can not figure out though, how the hell Espanyol is considered as a favorite in Almeria...! Espanyol have only won one in the last 6 games and that was against 10 men Rayo recently. We can see Rayo struggling can't we? Odds are going crazy in Almeria's favor, even a +0,25 ball was given at 1,8! I will make a step forward though and take the 'draw no bet' on Almeria at much better odds!

Onle left back Camara is out for Tenerife, important midfielder Leon (13/2) is boubtful but expected to play.

Cordoba on the other hand, have been struggling recently and it is the huge and key missings to lay all the blame.

Los Basques have the win over Barcelona to show last week and the away win in Malaga just before that and they have really make their numbers look much better.

A month ago Athletic was just like Levante one of the worst 'away teams' in the division but with their performance in Malaga and in the cup against Celta, where they didn't play as well as expected, they shown significant signs of improvement. A month ago Athletic had an average 1,33 shots on the opposite target in the last two they didn much better, 6 shots on target in Malaga and 7 in Celta and between these it was the win against Barcelona with another great display. So with a condifence boost they are traveling in Sevilla in almost full squad to play Rakitic-less Sevilla FC...!

Los sevillistas are in good form but today they are missing their best player, Rakitic who has been declared MVP in 6 games so far in the season! Sevilla is the favorite indeed but giving Athletic half ball in such odds is a very well offer we can't deny!";;0;0,5;1,95;7;6,65;2;

Last season a few games before the end of the season Celta won too easy in Valladolid by 0-2. I remember we had a bet on Valladolid then but it was like the pucelanos didn't even enter the field... It looked fishy at that time, but it could well be the motivation factor which was huge for Celta.
I decided to take Celta (0) today.

It's unbeliaveble but odds on Valladolid are keep diving and now Celta have reached amazing odds in favor!
The last season win wasn't the only one Celta have managed in Valladolid. In the last 12-13 years Celta have won 6 times there.

Athletic were fielded with only a couple of changes in the team, Toquero in attack was the big disappointment and keeper Herrera and despite the fact that Celta was set to play with noumerous changes they were fielded with a strong enough team. The problem for Athletic was that Celta looked like they wanted it more and deservedly won the first leg while now things should be excactly the opposite.

Athletic is a 'cup team' they want to go to the next stage and today they have only one obligated missing, Laporta in defence. Aduriz recovers position in the attacke, De Marcos will start on the becnh after playing impressively well in the right full back replacing master of the right wing, Iraola! De Marcos have played as left back, as right winger as center striker and now as a right full back! Amazing! Anyway, Athletic was brilliant in Sevilla deserved to win but were held in a 1-1 draw. They lost a penalty in the dying minutes of the 1st part. In overall, Athletic have been very much improved in recent games at home and on the road as well. The last team that lost in San Mames was Barcelona!

Celta are also aiming to get the ticket to the next round but they have no presure at all. They traveled without Yoel GLK**, Augusto MD**, Oubiρa MD*** who were dropped to get some rest. Osasuna is coming at the weekend in a crucial league game. The 2nd keeper will start, Sergio, plus Hugo Mallo and striker Charles who are suspedned in the league. Celta will be fielded with a mixture of regular and sub players.

Athletic have a full squad, a packed San Mames and plenty of motivation to win this and moreover to cover the 1-0 first leg defeat. It's worth a shot on them to cover the -1 handicap here.";;0;-1;1,69;7;4,83;2;

Today Espanyol needs a draw to get to the next round. Sergio García FW***, Mattioni RB, Fuentes LF*, Torje MD, Lanzatore MD and Tejera MD were dropped for technical decision with Simao and Pizzi taking another opportunity from Aguirre. Still, it isn't clear what these two are going to offer today in Espanyol as long as they expressed their will to leave the team in January... Espanyol will be fielded with a mixed team.

Jaen is a very nice team in segunda, they are giving us bets regularly and today they are going to play with their best team! They will score in Cornella, I don't know how many Espanyol will be able to net. This may means a 1-1 draw, or a 2-1 win for Espanyol even a 1-2 for Jaen or a 2-2 draw!

Estévez can not on important all around forward Jonas, recently appointed as regular center midfielder Oriol Romeu – who sent Banega in the bench - and center back Ricardo Costa. Nobody knows how many changes Estevez will go into this game but he included in the list some players from the B team and he will most probably uses them. He knows them very well of course! One of them is Guaya who has already played with the A' team.

On the other hand Nastic Tarragona traveled to pull off an upset. The goal-less draw in the first leg leaves everything on stake and Tarragona was very well prepared last week offering a nice performance. Most of the players will be the regulars, even though it doesn't make any difference for a team from 3rd division to play with the substitutes... Nastic remains unbeaten in the last 7 officials games.

Valencia needs to get a confidence mood but need to performe a players management ahead of the next games. On Sunday Real Madrid is traveling in Mestalla with the galacticos already winning the first battle: Sergio Ramos who was supposed to lose the game suspended received the clearence from the appeal committee to play!

Granada lost at home to 2nd division Alcorcon by 0-2 and was eliminated in  penalties shotout while Sociedad thrased Agleciras in the Anoeta by 4-0 and advanced in the next stage. Both played with many changes in the squad, Granada used more sub players and they paid the price.

Sociedad was also fielded with 7 changes in the team but they had no problems to overcome Algeciras. Of course this shows the quality gap between Granada and Sociedad. Despite some excellent individuals Granada lacks too much comparing to Real Sociedad and it is quite interesting to have Granada the favorite here!

Of course it is weird that Sociedad haven't won in Granada in three games since the Andalusians were promoted in primera division (one cup game included)!  I remember though the game two years ago when Illaramenti in his first steps in Sociedad got a 40 minute red card with Sociedad dominating most of the game until that minute while last season Granada was lucky enough to pick a goal-less draw against a superior Sociedad team. Anywya, nowadays both are in good shape, Sociedad more than any other time in the campaign and without any new missings they should be the underdog in Granada. Sociedad have the same squad that won Betis by 5-1, while Granada are waiting for the phisical condition of their regular defenders, Murillo and Angulo.";;0;0;2,07;7;7,49;2;

Sevilla have been under pretty good form recently but their weaknesses remain still and this was obvious in the last three games.

Sevilla suffered in Granada despite their victory and they suffered even more in the next two games played at home against Athletic Bilbao and Racing... Today they have an even more difficult mission against one of the hottest teams in La Liga, Villarreal, who have key defensive midfielder and captain, Bruno back in the squad. Cani, their offensive wheel remains out but Bruno is way more important and Cani's missing can partly be covered. Of course it would have been better if Cani was available, no doubt, but we have Sevilla traveling to Vila-Real without their two regular side backs, Albert Moreno, Spanish sub20 international, a great player way too helpful in offense too and Diogo RB.

Moises from B team got the call to cover the left back, Navarro is set to start though, while Coke who lost his place to Diogo will start in the right. Ok, the missing in the side full backs is never easy to cope with because these players usually constibute too much in attack, just like Alberto Moreno in Sevilla. Anyway, one more problem that may proved more important is Rakitic's health. The key Croacian midfielder lost the last game suspended and the midweek cup fiasco due to a heavy flu and even though he is back in the team he might still be effected by the fever suffered all these days. Villarreal is the favorite and will return in winning days against Sevilla who is not to be trusted and won more than they deserved recently.";;0;-0,5;2;7;-7,00;3;

Barcelona is 3 points below Atletico and for the first time in many years a different team than the 'big two' is very close to win the title of the 1st round champion!

And how excactly Barcelona will win in Getafe? Messi, Valdez are long term missings while now Neymar is suspended, already started his Christmas vacations in Brazil and moreover Xavi was a last minute dropp through injury!! Without Messi the Catalans struggled a bit but Neymar took over control winning crucial points for the team! No need to mention that without Xavi, Neymar was pretty much harmless, trying to win the opponents all alone.

Getafe on the other hand, recover confidence by the midweek win in the cup and the last home win against Levante and even though you can't compare Girona and Barcelona there is no doubt that they will play they best today. Always when facing a big rival like Barcelona all teams are giving their 110% one more now that Barcelona traveled with key missings and Getafe has a full squad to choose!

I don't need to mention that Getafe is always trying to beat the Catalans as long as their relations with the other two Madrid clubs, Atletico and Real are excellent. I am just telling you that Getafe's president is one of Real Madrid club members while Getafe has been always taking on loan players from Atletico! Do these facts make an important motivation today? No, but they are facts! Getafe will play their best today for their dignity and pride. With all these Catalan missings they can manage a positive result.";;0;1,25;2;7;-7,00;3;

In the round of 16 Athletic will play in Betis on January 8 and Rayo will host Levante the next day. The return legs are being scheduled on January 15. So, both are in high morale but Athletic are in amazing form as well. In the last one and a half month the lions have manage to play the best soccer in the season and they deserve to be such a big favorite today. Athletic have a full squad except Laporte who remains injured.

On the other hand Rayo have yet to find their form. This game is important for them as well because nobody likes to be in relegation zone in Christmas time. This is not because of the bad taste of the turkey but of the morale coming out of this and the pressure in the team to get results after the break and being reingforced in the transfers. Rayo have key midfielder Saul back, he can play in defense as well while center back Rodri recovered a long time injury, almost a year out. Still defender Arbilla who can play in all positions is out, plus helpful striker Larivey who starts from the bench but his headers are one of a kind! He has already scored 4 goals and had some posts with his head! He could have been helpful today.

I am skipping Athletic's -1 handicap and going for the goals here. I doubt that Athletic wins with a 2-0 here. Rayo have to play soccer they are going to score today. Another reason I am skipping the -1 is that Rayo has good history stats in San Mames and this was with their current manager Paco Jemez. He may have found the winning formula to face Athletic...

No missings for Valencia, no cards opened from Estevez he has taken his job seriously enough!

Of course, it is a great honor to lead the profesional team than the youth or the B' one! Alcacer is set to take the starting up role in attack, Jonas right behind him, these will be the two forwards no other places are confirmed in the middle line. Estevez tried a team like the one Djukic was using in the early stages of the campaign but this was most probably because he wanted to rest some of the players who are going to play today.

Real, on the other hand, traveled without Bale but with Sergio Ramos included in the list! Ramos was sent off last week in Osasuna but he got the clearence to play today from the appeal committee who saw no 'tention' on Ramos elbowing  the Osasuna player! Anyway, no other missings for Real who have no room to let more points slip away from them. They are 8 points below Atletico Madrid and even though this doesn't make any betting argument, ofc, it guarentees that the Madridistas will play their 100% today!

For all their dominance,for all their chances, they never capitalised and never really convinced,
allowing Elche windows of opportunity which were duly exploited. It has to be said that the cdef
pairing of Mathieu and Costa are pretty much impresentable at this level and therein lie large part
of their troubles.
A significant change of tone from President Amedeo Salvo (previously:Djukic stays no matter what
happens) with regard to the coach. With new Sports Director (ex Valencia player) Rufete installed
and given sweeping powers, Salvo has insinuated that any decision regarding the coach will now
be taken by Rufete. Expect Djukic to be gone very shortly ie Monday if things do not improve
drastically ie they don't win here.
The win in Swansea relieved the pressure somewhat, though having fielded practically a 1st choice
XI there may be consequences. Valencia got their goal and survived as Swansea lost their fwds and
had a seemingly good goal disallowed.
Banega is expected to return after a slight strain which prevented him facing Swansea. Javi Fuego is
set to return in cmf despite Romeu doing well in the Europa game, while Ricardo Costa is set to
return for Victor Ruiz at the back. The in form Bernat or the fresher Pabon on the left.
 
Osasuna were without a genuine No 9 in Valladolid (Oriol Riera suspended) and concentrated on a
rearguard action with De las Cuevas as makeshift attacker. Plenty of movement but not a whole lot
of end product. They were forced back more as the game went on but Oier managed to get the
winning goal against the run of play.
Osasuna have cmf Gato Silva and No 9 topscorer Oriol Riera back.
They are expected to remain the same at the back but Loe is expected to start in midfield to give
extra solidity alongside Silva, while similarly the defensive minded Oier may start in place of winger
Cejudo.
Djukic at least in recent times seems to have narrowed down his team selection to players who show
good attitude. They played pretty well in the unlucky defeat at Elche, and fought hard without
playing particularly well in the win at Swansea.
Osasuna are a pretty lightweight outfit without serious dangermen, but have been doing
reasonably well with a positive approach under Javi Gracia.In their last 5 away they only lost heavily 5-0 to Sociedad when down to 10 men early.If you take that result out they do not concede many 8 in the other  6 games.
Valencia won't be all that happy returning to the purgatory that is Mestalla on match day. Any
positive vibes can easily be swallowed up into the miasma of doom and gloom emanating from all
4 corners.I guess if Valencia hit 25 shots like last week, they can win this comfortably enough (hmm, except they lost last week...). But anyway, after a hard Europa game, and with the Mestalla factor, there is room for plenty of doubt.and there home record of 3-1-3  11-10  makes the  + 1, 1 1/2  the best option.

1;0;0;01.12.13;01.12.13;Oddsmaker;Athletic;es;Barcelona;es;Athletic;Spain A;;"Athletic started well in Malaga with Iturraspe and Mikel Rico working very hard in midfield and
denying the opposition space. It was difficult for them to maintain that momentum and before HT
they slowed down and the defence was put under serious pressure before going behind.
But after the break they revived with the 3 subs introduced by Valverde pushing the home side
back. A San Jose header from a corner saw them push for the winner, which came through Muniain
who did well in a central role. Athletic with 4 wins and 2 draws (4-2-4) now from losing positions.
Entirely erratic, certainly, but with plenty of options tactically and on the bench.
No Aduriz again here, which is a bit of a conundrum. Kid Guillermo looks decent enough but is very
raw and was taken off on the hour again. Replacement Toquero plays a different sport, though I
guess we could say the same of the Barcelona central defenders.
Gurpegui is back fit but Valverde will likely stick with San Jose who despite not being a regular has
scored 3 decisive set piece goals already this season.
They return to their normal shape with Susaeta and Muniain on the wings and Herrera in central
midfield, which that De Marcos and Benat are again luxury reinforcements off the bench. It is a
more direct style where they will look to the pace on the wings to counter.
A comfortable but uninspiring victory for Barcelona at home to Granada. Their technical superiority
in attack earned them 2 soft penalties before Pedro saw to it that the reckless Iturra got a red card.
A tale of 3 stupid fouls, provoked by Barca´s superior skill. 4-0 but overall it was a dull , lifeless
performance which revived complaints about the Tata style.
Barca unsurprisingly were slated for their dreadful showing in Ajax midweek. Barca were
unrecognisable, with Ajax the side who pressed agressively, and had control and possession.
Dreadful at the back, Barca could make no impact in attack either even when up against 10 men.
No Messi of course, and no Busquets, who was on the bench, which explains a lot. But stil...worrying
stuff, this looked an aging side, and Barca ran 5km less than Ajax in the game. Reminiscent of the
Milan/Bayern CL debacles of last season.
Rback Alves Impt is still out, Montoya starts. Adriano returns at lback.
Cdef Puyol semireg, who struggled midweek, is out, so Bartra and Pique are the logical pairing.
Alexis can also come back, though having impressed in a central role may be pushed out wide with
Cesc in the Messi role.
Athletic are extremely erratic and keep going behind at home, with comebacks becoming a
specialty. They miss an experienced No 9 here, with kid Guillermo doing ok so far but lacking big
match presence and pedigree.
Barca will need to improve on the midweek shambles in Amsterdam. The return of Busquets will go a
long way towards fixing that, but Messi remains out and the defensive worries persist, with the side
struggling badly against pressing in CL.
The last 2 encounters here have been 2-2 draws, and i expect  Athletic to battle their way to a result here again.

The counter attack should be a big element of their game but here, again, they just faded away in the 2nd half and let Getafe come at them. With Baba out they had no real attacking outlet. They managed a late mini revival and hit the bar but overall didn't do enough. 4 straight defeats now, 1 goal scored in 5.Gk Navas R/I returns after suspension.
Cdef Rodas cdef Navarro Reg Reg remain injured, presumably lback Juanfran will slot inside if needed, with Karabelas coming in. Not massive disruption but not ideal.Main fwd Baba is back after missing the Getafe game.Also back Ruben, Ivanchiz And El dua.
Elche matched Atletico in most areas in a hard-fought game of few chances. Some poor keeping by Herrera saw them go behind, and Elche didn't have the quality to come back against a top side. Overall, a very solid and encouraging underdog display.Stalwart ex Barca B cdef Lomban Reg/Impt is out here and so it is likely that Pelegrin plays alongside Botia.
Fwd Manu del Moral remains out, so the erratic Boakye is expected to continue to lead the line with Corominas likely to be behind him.
 
Levante on 4 straight Liga defeats as well as another in Copa at Recreativo last weekend. In those 5 games they have only managed 1 goal.
Elche have been strong away from home with just 2 defeats so far, those coming in the opening weeks.
Levante seem to have the dead hand of Caparros on their shoulder these days, much like Mallorca last season.
Of course they may well come alive like against Espanyol: 7-8 weeks ago.
Elche seem capable and resilient and have their own arguments to win this game. Under these circumstances the plus is a bet

They have their inalterable style, courtesy of Paco Jemez. He should be handed the keys to Barcelona right away.Ok, they weren't all that good here (but were still better than Barcelona). That is mainly due to the fact that 75% of their players are rubbish. None more so than 2nd choice gk Codina,it seems. Ok, he made a brilliant save or 2 at the end but he had already cost them 2 goals and every chance of winning the game. 2-2 with a late equaliser from Bueno, but even this collection of 2nd-rate nobodies could well have won this if it weren't for Codina, who, let us emphasise for once and for all, DOES NOT LIKE CROSSES (we could say the same about their No 9 in this respect) AND CAN'T CATCH THE BALL. We won't see him in Liga for a while, anyway.
Cdef Ze Castro is back but has missed the last 2 months so is likely to start on the bench, with Galeano in the side alongside Galvez who also returns to Liga action after a very impressive Copa display in Valladolid.That makes the absence of cdef Saul Reg less relevant.
Adrian is likely to partner Trashorras in cmf. Nacho and Mojica contend the lback slot.
Granada, led by the impressive midfielder Fran Rico, passed well enough, and created enough chances, at home to Sevilla. But they were shocking in defence. A strange outfit, with a strange player in Murillo. He can be a brick wall for 3 games, then have a nightmare (remember that o.g v Getafe). Just really awful stuff that cost them at least a point after what was, overall, a respectable performance. So, horrible defending, poor finishing,and a somewhat unlucky defeat.
Granada beat Alcorcon away in Copa with their strongest side, Ighalo got both goals.
Cmf mainstay Iturra returns in cmf where Yebda is set to continue with Recio relegated to the bench.Buonanotte is suspended, no problem as they have plenty of options going forward especially with the return of Piti.
Rayo have just 1 win from their last 6.
Granada are consistently energetic though a lot of their good work goes to waste as they miss chances and defend erratically.
I  prefer Granada who have a decent midfield destroyer in Iturra and with ex Rayo fwd Piti the away also have the most dangerous man on the pitch.

I wasn't taking too much notice of it , truth be told. Just another manifestation of Catalan exceptionalism and snobbery. As the Chosen Ones, they must necessarily have a unique and superior brand of football. And as for what this little sudaca* in a bad suit on the sideline offers us...weellll...as Catalans we had better hold our nose.A simple cocktail of innate prejudices, and leftover pockets of resistance from Laporta/Guardiola/Cruyffian elements. Besides all that, the Catalan national sport is not football, or thievery, or even roller-hockey, but complaining.So, the sound of Catalans complaining. You go deaf after a while.Then that that horrific, soul destroying, utterly depressing, near unwatchable 4-0 win over Granada had me wondering if there was something in the anti Tata argument after all. Am I the one blinded by anti Catalan prejudices, after all? Yes, probably. Though probably not so much blind, as deaf.
To San Mames, where things really did fall apart. 1 shot on target. Ok, there were 10-15 minutes of old-school possession, in the 1st half. To no effect, before the ball was abandoned. There was the Iturraspe-Neymar foul at 0-0, which the referee could have/should have punished with a red card. But he didn't - they seemed to have temporarily lost their magic powers also in this regard.
And the Muniain goal, which was point-blank and unmissable...except Valdes would have saved it, somehow.They have lost his magical powers too, for now. And soon, for good.Xavi subbed, yet again. Without a replacement. Someone sold Thiago.Neymar, meanwhile, has his moments. But he is no CR7, and is no Messi. And we can't even be sure he is Deulofeu. Someone loaned Deulofeu, and paid 150m for Neymar.Of course, there remains Messi, who will save them on many an occasion, no doubt.Of course, losing in resurgent Bilbao, and even Amsterdam, can happen. And Barca will by default win most of their games in Liga in any case. But a loss of energy and identity is glaringly apparent. Whatever happened to all that back-to-the future pressing we saw on Day 1 v Levante? Presumably, they can't do it.Tata has changed the style. I guess he didn't want to, but needed to do something, anything, to halt the slide of recent times. It isn't working right now, and there probably isn't a whole lot that will work. They can't play like they used to, either. If they could, they would. They are where they are.Those demanding back-to-the-future tactics forget that the team is going, going, soon-to-be-gone.Tata seems a good-but-flawed coach with supposedly archaic training methods, a good and likeable man. It'll take more than that to survive when the dream-team is in terminal decline, the fans are in revolt and the press is out to get you. A very easy target to aim at. And the clown Rosell ready to press the Big Phil button in the summer.All the criticism at least served to spark Barca back into life with an impressive 6-1 win over Celtic in the midweek CL game. Admittedly Celtic were awful but Barca at least showed they can still put on an exhibition against ordinary teams. Which is something positive at least. Neymar was the star but Sergi Roberto played his most complete game for Barca, impressive stuff from the kid.Cesc is however back again to the detriment probably of Sergi. Or else Neymar, who may be shunted out wide again.Iniesta is also expected to come back into the side after being on the bench against Celtic with Xavi likely rested on the bench.Montoya is likely to play at right back with Dani Alves still injured, as are Valdes, Messi while squad lback Adriano is supended.
Villarreal never looked particularly fluid at home to Malaga. Nonetheless they managed enough attacks to get themselves in front through Bruno. Up against mediocre but stubborn opposition, Villarreal sat back and tried to counter, but never managed to kill the game off. Sub Giovanni wasnt at his best after missing several games. It looked to be a routine, unimpressive 1-0 win until they conceded from a corner in the 94th minute Key cmf Bruno took his 5th yellow and is a massive loss for this.Lmf dangerman Cani Impt /Key is also out.They are expected to play the same defence as in their last league game with Gabriel keeping his place.In midfield the solid but limited Pina is likely to start for Bruno. Sort of guy who will chase shadows here and take a card or 2. Aquino and Hernan Perez are set to be on the wings, with Uche and Giovani in attack.
Barcelona found some fluidity and flair midweek, whilst still showing vulnerabilities with the defence weak and Pinto unconvincing.
Villa arrive without their 2 star international class midfielders. They have dangerous pacy fwds in Uche and Gio but there will not be a whole lot of service and Pina could get frustrated chasing in midfield.Marcelino has done quite well against Barca on several occasions with Racing and Sevilla, and may have a clever tactical set-up again here. Though it is hard to see them survive without their 2 best midfielders on this occasion.
So i expect Barcelona to win and beat the handicap

At 1-0 down, Schuster's side worked hard and kept in the game with a decent amount of harmless possession. Juanmi had a good chance saved, and Malaga hadn't really done much to equalise.Weligton's 94th minute equaliser came from a corner. All told, a dogged, disciplined showing, with good attitude.Off the field, the club have re-hired the capable sports director Mario Husillos, who resigned in the summer chaos. He will bring some order to the chaotic recruitment process. But unless they pay Demichelis what he is owed, they will not be able to sign in the window.The only player missing is still fwd El Hamdaoui who has been struggling with a mystery injury which nobody has managed to diagnose. Meanwhile he is putting on a lot of weight. No wonder he came on a free...Cdef Weligton Impt returns for Angeleri who has been struggling.Juanmi is likely to lead the line again, with Rocky IX also available.
Getafe huffed and puffed in a dull game at home to Levante. Eventually the away side renounced all hope of counter attacking, merely hoofing theball out of defence at every opportunity. The pressure from Getafe hadn't produced many clear chances but Pedro Leon efficiently dispatched after a poor clearance to take the 3 points. Hard to say a team deserves the win after 2 shots on target. But Levante deserved nothing, so...
In Copa they rested several players as they drew 1-1 away to Girona.
Lback Escudero semireg and cmf Borja Reg/Impt are both suspended which means that Roberto Lago and Lacen are set to come into the side. Cdef Lisandro Lopez Impt also returns after a month injured and he comes in for Rafa.
 
The pressure is seriously on Schuster after the Copa debacle, turning a 3-0 lead into a 3-3 draw against Osasuna. The coach is continually tinkering and meddling, unsure of his best team and best tactics and uable to make intelligent substitutions.
Getafe will be happy enough to let the pressure build on Malaga, whose fans are on the brink of revolt.On the back of that, and the good counters they are capable of  I expect the away to sneak a result.

direct football, with Cordoba getting the better of them. The injury to Cordoba gave them breathing space,
and the introduction of Pardo gave them genuine quality and creativity, something which they had lacked
with the disappointing Ros on the pitch. Sociedad took control and duly won the game, albeit with a touch of
fortune with a late o.g, but the pressure had been building.Sociedad put some energy into the meaningless CL encounter but seemed to lack the adrenaline to go flatout and consequently lost a fairly even game.
Cdef Mikel Reg is out replaced by the capable Ansotegi. De la Bella Reg remains out so the capable J Angel continues at lback.Chory Castro comes back to give them extra options in attack.All fairly routine.
Betis got a 2-goal free pass from Rayo gk Codina and still couldn't get a win. On overall play the home side didn't deserve much more than a draw after yet another disjointed performance. It was a breathless encounter, all rapid transitions and desperation. Once again, the Betis defence could not hold. Bueno's late equaliser cost Pep Mel his job.
Not entirely surprising that a bottom-of-Liga coach gets fired, though Mel, who is a lifetime betico, remains a
very popular figure with the fans. After 3 1/2 seasons in which he led them from 2nda to Europa, while in
administration, nobody was calling for his head. The typical scenario unfolded at the weekend: the fans turned
on the President, the President fires the coach, who was the Liga's longest serving.
Mel's contract included a clause which sees a reduced pay off if the club spends 5 weeks in the drop zone.
Sunday was the 5th week. He knew that Stosic and Gordillo had met Garrido. He knew he had to win. 90th
minute equalisers, eh? Though I do wonder what the lawyers would have made of a 4-way tie at the bottom.
Upon this news, the fans are thrown into tumult and uproar, with the press room under siege from fans as the
measure was announced to journalists.If that wasn't bad enough, bafflingly, bizarrely, they go and appoint the clown Garrido of Villarreal and Bruges infamy, who had already been lined up for a week. The people (mainly Stosic) who made all the signings and sales already have a lot to answer for, without adding a Garrido into the mix.In another brain-dead move, the club have announced that from now on they will be charging triallist kids 150 Euros per head.
A nondescript win away to 10 man 2B Lleida was followed up by a dull 00 at home to Rijeka in Europa, where
they lost gk Sara Reg and cmf Xavi Torres Reg/Impt injured (LT).A bit thin in cmf now with Nosa also out LT.
Molina, Vadillo and Ruben Castro all return to boost the toothless attack, though star man Castro is still unlikely
to be in top form what with injuries, domestic violence charges, nights out on the town and general dismay
over the Pepe Mel sacking.
Sociedad on a decent 5-1-1 run in Liga since CL became a secondary objective, the only defeat coming in
Madrid when they seemed to take the day off.
Betis will likely be a far more cautious outfit initially as Garrido tries to steady the ship. Though one gets the
feeling Betis have hired their very own Captain Schettino.
Sociedad's better quality against Betis's dead-cat bounce. Betis probably aren't as bad as the table would
indicate and with Ruben Castro back are due some kind of improvement sooner or later.But they aren't very
good, either.
Sociedad are better, and I expect their smart forward line to come out on top.

easily have lost as won. But in Bacca they have a rampaging bull, the Colombian fwd scoring and setting up
the late winner for Gameiro. Bacca is in form, 3 points, but they never really convinced here.
Mf playmaker/No 10 Rakitic Key is suspended here having starred midweek in Freiburg.
Cristoforo could come in to play alongside Iborra and M’Bia in a midfield that lacks creativity. They could also
try Reyes in the No 10 role.5 players should repeat from Thu, including star fwd Bacca.
Athletic held firm when they needed to, emerging from a 10-15 minute spell of Barca dominance unscathed in
the 1st half. Valverde and the team realised there was nothing to fear and turned up the heat as San Mames
bayed for Barcelona blood. Athletic won all the battles as well as keeping control of the ball when necessary. A
mature performance, though it didn't take too much to beat this Barca.
Athletic were brought down to earth with a grim showing in Copa as their 1st XI lost 1-0 away to Celta's 2nd XI.
No problems, Aduriz should return up front after his 2 game suspension.
Sevilla with plenty of vulnerabilities, and their 4 home wins have come against the bottom sides. They also miss 7
goal/5 assist Rakitic.
Athletic have been almost invariably awful on the road, even when they have been winning. Perhaps the
nature of the opposition will shake them from their lethargy. So far, they haven't bothered to try against the top
sides, or the bottom sides. Sevilla might just suit them.
Both sides vulnerable defensively and extremely unreliable. No Rakitic, and at +1/2 goal Athletic look good

Valladolid drew 00 at home to Rayo in Copa and failed to seriously trouble the away defence.
Star man Ebert seems ot be losing patience with the set-up under JIM. He says that at times 'there are only 9 people out there running instead of 11”and that “all this possession is ineffective. We need to go out and win, not play pretty football'.No problems, just the usual squad/LTs, though on a positive note No 10 Oscar and cmf Victor Perez should both be in the squad. Important players, though they are most likely to start on the bench after LT injury.
Celta finally managed to convert possession and chances into a win, scoring 3 and hitting the woodwork twice in a comfortable win over Almeria. They had gone behind as Joel let in a soft effort from distance but recovered well to dominate completely, with Rafinha starring yet again. Luis Enrique had brought in Orellana, and the Chilean added some much-needed subtlety to the attack in place of the head-down dribbler Nolito.
Celta fielded a weakened side at home to Athletic but took a deserved 1-0 win thanks to a goal from emerging talent Santi Mina.
Krohn Dehli and Orellana should keep their places, which means that Augusto Fernandez and Nolito are on the bench.
A 2200 k.o on a Monday night, with temperatures due to fall to zero, so plenty of people will stay home to watch this on free TV. The TV people better hope the fog stays away.
Valladolid are not very good and  as Ebert points out, they aren't all that good to be playing tikitaka. JIM under real pressure now.They only won 1 game at home 1-3-3 record
Celta still haven't won 2 successive Liga games.LE has set them the objective to win another away game here and set themselves up for a decent run.They are not bad away from home playing on the counter record 3-0-4
Celta look better, have been decent on the road, so I expect them to get a result here.

With his tactics and deadline-day singings, Roberto Martinez has added to the solid foundations left by David Moyes. His side remain hard to beat - only Manchester City have managed to beat them so far - but crucially now look more likely to win games, particularly away from home when they can play on the counter with fast players like Lukaku and Miralas. With that in mind, I'm happy to side with them in the draw-no-bet market at 1.80. Everton's record suggests the chance of losing money is slim, while they have the form to win this game, Gareth Barry and James McCarthy are players who are good in  protecting their back four and the main reason why Everton have lost just that single game. Everton have James McCarthy back available On-loan Barcelona forward Gerard Deulofeu who has been impressive has been ruled out with the hamstring injury he sustained against Fulham, Fellow defender Leighton Baines is continuing to work his way back from a broken toe,
Swansea, who have failed to score against Everton in all four of their Premier League meetings, have not performed to the high standards they have set themselves and they arrive here with just two wins from their last 12 games in all competitions and quite often look toothless in attack . Injuries have not helped their cause. Forward Michu is a doubt for Sunday's clash.while Nathan Dyer is facing a long spell on the sidelines after suffering ankle ligament damage at Norwich and Michel Vorm has undergone ankle surgery.Garry Monk continues to be ruled out with a knee problem, but Leon Britton and Chico Flores should return from a toe injury and suspension respectively but Rangel is suspended.";;0;0;1,8;8;6,4;2;
1;0;0;22.12.13;22.12.13;Oddsmaker;Espanyol;es;Valladolid;es;Valladolid;Spain A;;"Espanyol adopted a wait-and-see approach in Elche, hoping to steal a goal but not risking anything. The result was stalemate, with the home side unable to seriously threaten, other than a missed penalty Midweek a mixed B side beat Jaen,2-0.

Espanyol have rback Javi Lopez Reg/Impt back after suspension. They are full strength here.

 

It was all looking fairly even on a freezing night between Valladolid and Celta until the freak red card for Charles. Up against 10, Valladolid soon took the lead through a nicely taken goal from Guerra who cleaned up against the exposed away side.

Valladolid put out a fairly decent XI in Rayo midweek but found themselves a man down with Javi Guerra sent off at the start of the 2nd half and were easily beaten in the end.

Having welcomed back No 10 Oscar Impt/Key as a sub last weekend it looks as though he may still not be ready to start. Meanwhile cmf Victor Perez Impt is also likely to be on the bench as he recovers from LT injury.No other notable problems.

 

2 very modest and limited sides here, neither of which inspires a huge amount of confidence. Though at the prices, the 1.89 +3/4/ away win bettable Espaniol of 3 wins at home cannot be giving such a handicap. I mean, Espanyol just hoof it up the field to Cordoba and hope. A lot of teams, including Valladolid, can deal with that.

1;0;0;22.12.13;22.12.13;Oddsmaker;Getafe;es;Barcelona;es;Getafe;Spain A;;" Getafe only sat back in Malaga, hoping to hang on for the 0-0. They survived until quite late on when Santa Cruz punished their lack of ambition. Dismal stuff and they deserved nothing.In true flat-track style, Getafe bounced back to eliminate a weak Girona side midweek.Full strength here, so it only remains to be seen what tactical variance Luis Garcia opts for. Expect the usual counter attack style, and heavy dependence on Pedro Leon's set pieces.
Barcelona dominated most of the game against Villarreal but could still only translate that into a narrow win, as they continue to look vulnerable at the back, conceding from another set piece.
They were struggling to break Villarreal down and made the initial breakthrough with a handball penalty. Fortuitous, though it did come as a result of their territorial domination. At least Neymar showed up again to make the decisive contribution.
Midweek a non-event at home to Cartagena saw Barca sleepwalk their way to a 3-0 win that left more questions than answers, with the away side hitting the woodwork twice and generally causing a lot more problems than one would reasonably expect.
Messi blew a fuse in unprecedented fashion, going very public on a top news program to vent at the nobody in the Rosell junta who had stated there will be no contract upgrade. The nobody was probably speaking on behalf of somebody, of course, and therefore warranted a real blast of Messi media power. Rosell is certainly clumsy, very probably foolish, and capable of anything.
Gk Valdes Impt and rback Alves Impt remain out.
They are joined by Xavi reg/impt and of course Messi and the suspended Neymar.
Sergi Roberto could play in the Xavi slot, with Cesc in attack. I can have a go at Cesc again and he'll no doubt score if I do. Or will he? Suffice to say he is not a false 9, he is not a Xavi, and his play is irredeemably narcissistic, burdened by the weight of ego and neediness.
Of course, Martino should travel light: play Alexis in the centre and leave Cesc on the bench or let him stew in midfield.
Just in case I am wrong, Cesc can be found at 25/1 for the hat-trick in all disreputable bookmakers.
Getafe are pretty dreadful, almost entirely reliant on Pedro Leon, but have occasionally been capable of a performance and result beyond their means. Set pieces will be their main hope here and they have good reason to be optimistic in that regard.
Barca without all the glitter and glamour of their 2 real game-changers here. Also, while Xavi is surely fading these days,he is still an important miss. Sergi Roberto looks very good, is improving fast but is
Inexperienced.All adds up to oppose Barca ; starless in attack, feckless in defence.
