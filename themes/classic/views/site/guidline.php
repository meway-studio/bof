				<span class="q-name">How and why use BetOnFootball:</span>
				<span class="q-romb">The main rule of  BetOnFootball is nothing extra, but football bets.</span>
				<span class="q-romb">BetOnFootball is a team of football analysts, one for each leading European championship (The UK, Spain, Germany, Italy, France and Holland).</span>
				<span class="q-romb">Paid subscription is effected for all the analysts, but not for each one separately.</span>
				<span class="q-romb">There are different subscription terms: 1 bet (forecast), 1 match day, weekends, a month, 3 months and a season.</span>
				<span class="q-romb">In the user’s personal account, having filled in “E-mail” and “Phone” areas, the subscription for you will look the following way: you receive SMS, which says that the new forecast is added to your personal account and e-mail message is sent to you. You chose yourself the most convenient for you way of making yourself aware of the materials (in your personal account on BOF site or via e-mail).</span>
				<span class="q-romb"> For the sake of convenience we have created BOF journal for you, which will be issued on a regular basis on match days and “accumulate” all the forecasts of all the BOF analysts.</span>
				<span class="q-romb">Apart from the journal and “early bets” not included in the journal, there will be forecasts 30 minutes before the match starts, when the team lists for the game are already known and in some cases during the match itself.</span>
				<span class="q-romb"> To get free forecasts, as well as to get an opportunity to buy the forecast, each site visitor is offered an easy sign up procedure.</span>
				<span class="q-romb"> Please, do not hesitate to address us any of your questions or concerns using feedback form, e-mail, skype or telephone.</span>
				<span class="q-romb">New forecasts as well as the latest 7 matches statistics are always displayed on the main page of our site.</span>
				<span class="q-caps">You may anytime find Statistics on each BOF analyst as well as the whole project in our Statistics section</span>
				<span class="q-caps">Let’s earn together!</span>

				<span class="q-name">12 g<span class="gold">olden</span> rules for betting</span>
				<span class="q-caps">Basing on the understanding that gaming events have always been accompanying human existence and will continue to in future, one can state with confidence that the desire to bet on the outcome of a certain sports contest, bet on the result, win and, unfortunately, lose will always exist. That’s why it’s important to minimize negative consequences of your bets.</span>
				<span class="q-little">BetonFootball recommends using services of the Betfair betting exchange created in the UK in 1999. The Betfair has eliminated the traditional bookmaker as an intermediary between bettors and thus made it possible and profitable to place bets skipping the bookmaker office. Since that very moment any player is able to choose himself a person to bet against. Taking into consideration our personal ten-year experience we can well afford to offer a few ideas-rules you always have to keep in mind:</span>
				<div  class="rules">
					<div class="rules-column">
						<div class="some-rule">
							<span class="rule-count">1</span>
							<span class="rule-text">Bet on a sports event but by no means on the odds which can be both too low if an event’s result is evident or too high in case of a bookmaker’s mistake or bias in the informational realm.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="some-rule">
							<span class="rule-count">3</span>
							<span class="rule-text">The second rule is tightly linked to the third one – you may lose everything in a day but you never can win everything immediately.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="some-rule">
							<span class="rule-count">5</span>
							<span class="rule-text">Place only single bets because even two events mean an express. 1 gaming day – 1 ordinary – 1 express.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="some-rule">
							<span class="rule-count">7</span>
							<span class="rule-text">The sixth point is linked to the following one: be constrained both in the cases of loss and win. If you keep winning three times in a row you shouldn’t be too enthusiastic and bet indiscriminately on everything or do vice versa: a series of loses can make you place ill-judged bets with the only desire to return your money. You shouldn’t do it either. Don’t fuss, don’t hurry to place a bet and control your feelings. Always keep in mind the amount of money you have already brought in, the sum you wish to get and the time period in which you wish to get it.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="some-rule">
							<span class="rule-count">9</span>
							<span class="rule-text">Don’t bet for the sake of a bet. Determine the sphere of you interest: the type of sports you are interested most.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="some-rule">
							<span class="rule-count">11</span>
							<span class="rule-text">Open an account at the Betfair betting exchange. We assure: it’s very pleasant to withdraw money from Betfair.</span>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="rules-column">
						<div class="some-rule">
							<span class="rule-count">2</span>
							<span class="rule-text">Be ready to lose because it’s impossible both to win and lose constantly. Despondency and disappointment can’t be your friends in the betting issue.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="some-rule">
							<span class="rule-count">4</span>
							<span class="rule-text">Among the events of a gaming day choose only one, of the result of which you are confident most. As the player always knows at least one result, but can’t separate it from a series of gaming events, we suggest relying on our advice: place 1 ordinary on a gaming day and one 1 express on everything you like. Thus you get cash from the ordinary and the express lets you have an exciting and interesting viewing of a match: as you have bet on it!</span>
						</div>
						<div class="some-rule">
							<span class="rule-count">6</span>
							<span class="rule-text">Any player is inherently a hot-tempered person, that’s why it’s important to keep your head. You should never bet your last money as you run the risk of losing everything on the first of the gaming days and skip a bet which can bring profit to you on the second gaming day.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="some-rule">
							<span class="rule-count">8</span>
							<span class="rule-text">Bet only in case of being confident of the result. However, we notice that there can’t be a 100% confidence. As practice shows, even in the football match Barcelona against Rubin you can be only 95% confident of Barcelona’s win and set 5% for the “anything can happen” case. Anyway these 5% give you a chance to analyze all the factors leading to loss. This is the experience you gain gradually and which will ultimately lead you to the positive result in such a difficult issue as betting.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="some-rule">
							<span class="rule-count">10</span>
							<span class="rule-text">You have won money – withdraw it. You should withdraw money in CASH twice a month if you bet frequently and once a month if you bet more seldom. If you don’t stick to this rule you may lose everything.</span>
						</div>
						<div class="some-rule">
							<span class="rule-count">12</span>
							<span class="rule-text">Stick to the rules from the very beginning since they make up a system. In other words these are logically bound principles representing an integral composition.</span>
